1
00:00:03,375 --> 00:00:04,537
The moment we have enough

2
00:00:04,562 --> 00:00:06,474
information to prove
that Black Dagger's real,

3
00:00:06,499 --> 00:00:08,444
- we go straight to the FBI.
- We work together

4
00:00:08,469 --> 00:00:09,227
as a family.

5
00:00:09,252 --> 00:00:12,056
The O'Connor family
are your responsibility.

6
00:00:12,081 --> 00:00:13,067
You will know every

7
00:00:13,093 --> 00:00:14,583
conversation that they have.

8
00:00:14,608 --> 00:00:15,974
If you cannot accomplish this,

9
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:17,039
I have men who will.

10
00:00:17,064 --> 00:00:18,733
_

11
00:00:18,758 --> 00:00:20,633
Why can't I stay away from you?

12
00:00:20,658 --> 00:00:22,882
Are we really going to do this again?

13
00:00:23,249 --> 00:00:25,249
You remember the name Oleg Zhulov?

14
00:00:25,274 --> 00:00:26,593
Call TSA, have him put

15
00:00:26,618 --> 00:00:27,725
on a no-fly list.

16
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,206
These numbers are bank accounts.

17
00:00:29,231 --> 00:00:30,257
You got money whipping

18
00:00:30,282 --> 00:00:31,546
all around the world

19
00:00:31,571 --> 00:00:32,634
in a plan to make

20
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:34,207
a very big explosion.

21
00:00:34,232 --> 00:00:35,490
The specific accounts are under

22
00:00:35,515 --> 00:00:36,931
the control of Scott Tolliver.

23
00:00:36,956 --> 00:00:38,103
If he's moving the money,

24
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:39,857
he's our only link to Black Dagger.

25
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:43,024
Agh! Bitch!

26
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:44,502
Katya, Katya, wait!

27
00:00:44,527 --> 00:00:45,457
Wait, wait, wait.

28
00:00:50,185 --> 00:00:51,830
Dad, Dad!

29
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:02,798
_

30
00:01:06,061 --> 00:01:07,724
Next.

31
00:01:07,749 --> 00:01:09,420
Where are you traveling?

32
00:01:09,445 --> 00:01:10,638
Frankfurt.

33
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:18,006
Is there a problem?

34
00:01:18,031 --> 00:01:19,567
Sorry, computer's frozen.

35
00:01:19,592 --> 00:01:21,424
Just give me one second.

36
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,834
All units, be on the lookout

37
00:01:38,859 --> 00:01:40,102
for a white male,

38
00:01:40,127 --> 00:01:41,074
"approximately 6'2" tall,

39
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:42,507
bald, black wool coat.

40
00:01:42,532 --> 00:01:43,253
Excuse me.

41
00:01:45,028 --> 00:01:47,257
North exit's clear. Suspect spotted

42
00:01:47,282 --> 00:01:48,433
heading to the east exit.

43
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,726
Repeat, suspect's heading

44
00:01:49,751 --> 00:01:51,107
to the east exit.

45
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:10,308
I'll be okay.

46
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:11,419
It's just a stun gun.

47
00:02:11,444 --> 00:02:12,459
It's okay.

48
00:02:12,484 --> 00:02:14,251
You told me you had this under control.

49
00:02:14,276 --> 00:02:16,226
- Calm down.
- This does not look under control!

50
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:17,356
Remember what's at stake here.

51
00:02:17,516 --> 00:02:18,717
This is what we have to do

52
00:02:18,742 --> 00:02:19,740
to stop Black Dagger.

53
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:21,085
We will handle it.

54
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,772
And right now we have
to get you out of here

55
00:02:22,797 --> 00:02:24,208
before he wakes up and sees you.

56
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:25,406
Alex, go.

57
00:02:43,123 --> 00:02:44,123
Hello?

58
00:02:44,148 --> 00:02:45,281
I wake you?

59
00:02:45,312 --> 00:02:46,588
No, I'm up. What's going on?

60
00:02:46,613 --> 00:02:48,313
Why do you look so worried?

61
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:52,868
Are you watching me?

62
00:02:52,893 --> 00:02:54,918
No, but the sound of your voice tells me

63
00:02:54,943 --> 00:02:56,212
what your face is doing.

64
00:02:56,237 --> 00:02:58,554
Remember Oleg Zhulov, SVR officer,

65
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:01,328
who told Irina Semovetskaya
about Black Dagger?

66
00:03:01,353 --> 00:03:02,833
He tried to fly out of JFK tonight.

67
00:03:02,858 --> 00:03:03,601
Tried?

68
00:03:03,626 --> 00:03:06,012
Fortunately, he was bounced
back by our no-fly order.

69
00:03:06,037 --> 00:03:08,180
Unfortunately, he slipped
Port Authority police

70
00:03:08,205 --> 00:03:08,983
at the airport.

71
00:03:09,007 --> 00:03:10,830
I need you at work now.

72
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:16,488
- You all right?
- Yes, yes.

73
00:03:16,513 --> 00:03:17,150
Mom, you okay?

74
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,450
Katya. Katya, wait!

75
00:03:21,475 --> 00:03:22,691
Aah!

76
00:03:22,716 --> 00:03:23,838
We need to talk.

77
00:03:23,863 --> 00:03:25,863
If you want money, I'll give you money.

78
00:03:25,888 --> 00:03:27,144
We're not here to rob you.

79
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:28,104
Then what do you want?

80
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:30,246
These numbers, right here...

81
00:03:30,271 --> 00:03:32,996
accounts at your bank,
accounts you control.

82
00:03:33,021 --> 00:03:34,535
The money deposited in them,

83
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,801
we need to know where it ends up.

84
00:03:35,826 --> 00:03:36,981
I don't know what you're talking about.

85
00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:38,933
Don't lie. We don't want to hurt you.

86
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,022
I want to hurt him.

87
00:03:40,048 --> 00:03:41,856
I just chop it up.

88
00:03:42,254 --> 00:03:45,371
Any transaction over $10,000,

89
00:03:45,396 --> 00:03:46,396
the Feds are alerted.

90
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:47,421
It's automatic.

91
00:03:47,446 --> 00:03:49,446
If you need to move a
lot of money discretely,

92
00:03:49,471 --> 00:03:52,634
you cut it up and move
it in packets under 10K,

93
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,129
under the radar.

94
00:03:54,154 --> 00:03:54,794
Am I bleeding?

95
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:56,629
No, Scott, you're sweating.

96
00:03:56,654 --> 00:03:58,486
If this ends up with you bleeding,

97
00:03:58,511 --> 00:03:59,988
trust me, you'll know the difference.

98
00:04:00,013 --> 00:04:00,989
Where do the packets go?

99
00:04:01,014 --> 00:04:01,730
All over.

100
00:04:01,755 --> 00:04:04,133
Hundreds of different
accounts, different banks.

101
00:04:04,388 --> 00:04:07,388
And eventually, they all
land in the same place,

102
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,886
usually an account overseas.

103
00:04:08,911 --> 00:04:11,371
These packets, Scott.

104
00:04:11,396 --> 00:04:12,902
Where does this money end up?

105
00:04:12,927 --> 00:04:14,768
I don't know where any
of the money ends up.

106
00:04:14,793 --> 00:04:16,793
I only know as much as I need to know

107
00:04:16,818 --> 00:04:17,818
to do my little piece.

108
00:04:17,942 --> 00:04:21,449
My boss is the only one who
knows the final destination.

109
00:04:21,638 --> 00:04:24,457
- Your boss?
- Yes, my boss.

110
00:04:24,482 --> 00:04:26,482
He's the one who has what you need?

111
00:04:26,685 --> 00:04:28,884
You kidnapped the wrong guy.

112
00:04:35,082 --> 00:04:37,082
We have to figure out
what we're doing next.

113
00:04:37,107 --> 00:04:38,769
We can't just walk away.

114
00:04:38,794 --> 00:04:41,794
We work with what we have,
and what we have is him.

115
00:04:50,512 --> 00:04:54,512
Scott, we need to find that money.

116
00:04:54,537 --> 00:04:56,074
Well, I don't know where it goes.

117
00:04:56,099 --> 00:04:57,637
I already told you what I know.

118
00:04:57,662 --> 00:04:59,648
See, but we haven't told
you everything that we know,

119
00:04:59,673 --> 00:05:02,224
like how you've been skimming
from your "off book" clients

120
00:05:02,249 --> 00:05:03,374
like the, uh...

121
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,806
The cartel.

122
00:05:05,106 --> 00:05:06,856
Torreon Cartel.

123
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:08,917
They'll kill me.

124
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:10,221
Probably.

125
00:05:10,247 --> 00:05:12,761
Luckily when they kill people
who steal from them, it's quick.

126
00:05:12,786 --> 00:05:13,786
Hmm.

127
00:05:13,825 --> 00:05:16,712
Oh, no, it's the opposite of that.

128
00:05:16,737 --> 00:05:18,737
Oh, right, slow.

129
00:05:18,888 --> 00:05:20,888
He has a ledger.

130
00:05:21,645 --> 00:05:22,645
What?

131
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:25,120
My boss, he doesn't believe
any computer is secure.

132
00:05:25,146 --> 00:05:27,641
He writes down all the destination accounts

133
00:05:27,665 --> 00:05:30,240
by hand in a ledger.

134
00:05:30,265 --> 00:05:32,402
What is this, 1975?

135
00:05:32,427 --> 00:05:33,179
Where's the ledger?

136
00:05:33,204 --> 00:05:36,356
In his office, locked up... 24-7 security.

137
00:05:36,381 --> 00:05:37,381
You can't get in.

138
00:05:37,406 --> 00:05:38,733
Who do you think you're dealing with?

139
00:05:38,758 --> 00:05:40,574
Seriously, after what he

140
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:41,626
just witnessed from us.

141
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:43,651
Who are you people?

142
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:48,832
We need to do some research.

143
00:05:48,857 --> 00:05:50,530
Sarah wakes up in a couple of hours.

144
00:05:50,555 --> 00:05:52,130
Go home. I'll watch him.

145
00:05:52,156 --> 00:05:54,521
We'll get Sarah to school,
and then we're coming back.

146
00:05:54,546 --> 00:05:55,546
Okay?

147
00:05:55,571 --> 00:05:57,955
As long as it's with an actual plan.

148
00:06:14,805 --> 00:06:18,551
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

149
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:25,972
Welcome to the party.

150
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:28,699
We're here because of Oleg Zhulov.

151
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:29,858
Airport police lost him.

152
00:06:29,883 --> 00:06:31,699
We suspect he's gone underground,

153
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:33,241
probably with help from the Russian mafia.

154
00:06:33,266 --> 00:06:35,589
While we speak, our friends at ATF and DEA

155
00:06:35,614 --> 00:06:37,614
are raiding a nightclub
run by the Russian mafia.

156
00:06:38,313 --> 00:06:40,699
They've kindly agreed to
let us crash their party.

157
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:41,983
While they're looking for guns and drugs,

158
00:06:42,008 --> 00:06:43,414
we're gonna be looking for Zhulov

159
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,974
or anybody who can lead us to him.

160
00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:45,999
You okay?

161
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:47,336
Fine.

162
00:06:47,361 --> 00:06:49,712
Questions? Good, let's go.

163
00:06:57,999 --> 00:06:59,742
You ever been to this neighborhood?

164
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:00,358
No.

165
00:07:00,383 --> 00:07:01,687
You like Spanish food?

166
00:07:01,711 --> 00:07:03,752
Uh, they serve Spanish food here?

167
00:07:03,777 --> 00:07:04,578
God, no.

168
00:07:04,603 --> 00:07:06,227
You never eat the food
in a place like this.

169
00:07:06,252 --> 00:07:08,103
But there's a great place up the block.

170
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:09,272
I got to go back.

171
00:07:09,297 --> 00:07:11,575
I went to school with
this Spanish guy, Felipe.

172
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,000
Great guy.

173
00:07:13,025 --> 00:07:14,089
After our senior year,

174
00:07:14,114 --> 00:07:16,305
we rode motorcycles across North Africa.

175
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,835
Felipe decided he wanted to open
a motorcycle shop in Tangier.

176
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,473
Know what he's doing now?

177
00:07:21,498 --> 00:07:22,960
Uh, who?

178
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:25,217
Felipe.

179
00:07:25,423 --> 00:07:27,537
Selling motorcycles in Tangier?

180
00:07:27,562 --> 00:07:28,857
He's the king of Spain.

181
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:31,341
His father just abdicated.
He had to take his place.

182
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,090
Family, right?

183
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,234
Nothing more depressing

184
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:36,554
than a club with the music turned off.

185
00:07:36,579 --> 00:07:38,065
I can think of a few things.

186
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,090
That's 'cause you're a
dark, twisted soul, Prado.

187
00:07:40,115 --> 00:07:42,644
No, it's because I worked vice.

188
00:07:44,557 --> 00:07:46,105
Her.

189
00:07:47,283 --> 00:07:48,732
You were born in New York?

190
00:07:48,757 --> 00:07:50,165
Coney Island Hospital.

191
00:07:52,378 --> 00:07:54,377
Why are you carrying your passport?

192
00:07:54,402 --> 00:07:55,697
I lost my ID.

193
00:07:55,722 --> 00:07:58,113
Do you know where that scar
on your left arm is from?

194
00:07:58,931 --> 00:08:00,521
Bacillus Calmette-Guerin.

195
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:01,801
Tuberculosis vaccine.

196
00:08:01,826 --> 00:08:03,977
The risk here in America
is near zero, which is why

197
00:08:04,002 --> 00:08:05,913
the vaccination isn't
given in the United States.

198
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:07,924
But in countries with
high rates of tuberculosis,

199
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:09,353
everybody gets vaccinated.

200
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,345
Passport fraud, cocaine possession.

201
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,521
You're looking at ten
years in a federal prison.

202
00:08:16,546 --> 00:08:18,108
That's before we ship you
back to the motherland.

203
00:08:18,712 --> 00:08:20,878
What do you want to know?

204
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:25,049
Just tell us where a Russian
on the wrong side of the law

205
00:08:25,074 --> 00:08:26,913
gets a fake passport as good as yours.

206
00:08:27,338 --> 00:08:29,345
Then maybe we'll forget to arrest you.

207
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,623
Oh, sorry to disturb your nap.

208
00:08:38,648 --> 00:08:39,930
I'm sure.

209
00:08:39,954 --> 00:08:41,953
I took some E at the bar, okay?

210
00:08:41,978 --> 00:08:43,313
I'm a little thirsty.

211
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,969
You're rolling right now?

212
00:08:44,994 --> 00:08:47,994
In my defense, I didn't exactly expect

213
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:51,594
to be kidnapped, assaulted,
and tied to a chair tonight.

214
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:01,589
First cabinet on the left.

215
00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:06,508
Tap water?

216
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:07,533
Seriously?

217
00:09:07,626 --> 00:09:10,350
It's cancer water. Don't you read?

218
00:09:10,502 --> 00:09:12,784
The Times did a whole thing on it.

219
00:09:20,307 --> 00:09:21,437
Oh, that's good.

220
00:09:21,462 --> 00:09:23,462
You're welcome.

221
00:09:25,642 --> 00:09:28,642
You know, you guys are
one messed-up family,

222
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:30,213
especially Mommy Dearest.

223
00:09:30,238 --> 00:09:32,036
She doesn't give you what you need.

224
00:09:32,062 --> 00:09:33,342
You think it's your fault,

225
00:09:34,186 --> 00:09:36,186
maybe you're not good enough.

226
00:09:36,211 --> 00:09:38,211
So you keep trying
until you finally realize

227
00:09:38,236 --> 00:09:39,838
it's not your fault.

228
00:09:39,863 --> 00:09:40,972
It's hers.

229
00:09:41,298 --> 00:09:44,059
But by that time, you're so screwed up,

230
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,891
you can't really change.

231
00:09:47,549 --> 00:09:49,739
A bullet kills faster than cancer, Scott.

232
00:09:49,764 --> 00:09:50,764
Shut up.

233
00:09:50,963 --> 00:09:53,093
You know nothing about my mother.

234
00:09:53,117 --> 00:09:54,013
Whoa.

235
00:09:54,038 --> 00:09:55,562
Sorry.

236
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:57,125
Just trying to connect here.

237
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,909
Please don't.

238
00:10:03,384 --> 00:10:05,008
But I am right, aren't I?

239
00:10:05,033 --> 00:10:06,667
Why don't we talk about you?

240
00:10:07,837 --> 00:10:09,837
What's wrong with your mother?

241
00:10:09,862 --> 00:10:10,862
Nothing.

242
00:10:11,215 --> 00:10:14,249
She's a kindergarten teacher in Wisconsin.

243
00:10:14,892 --> 00:10:16,278
She's great.

244
00:10:17,185 --> 00:10:20,129
I'm not quite sure how I
turned into such a prick.

245
00:10:33,354 --> 00:10:35,193
Thanks.

246
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,790
Okay, that was not a good idea.

247
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,270
Let's not overreact.

248
00:10:47,712 --> 00:10:49,302
Honestly, after almost getting caught

249
00:10:49,327 --> 00:10:50,328
at Philadelphia City Hall,

250
00:10:50,361 --> 00:10:51,876
I don't really feel like breaking

251
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,343
into another highly
secure building just yet.

252
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:58,223
There's got to be something we
can use against Tolliver's boss.

253
00:10:58,248 --> 00:11:00,066
Look, Roger Yates, 65,

254
00:11:00,091 --> 00:11:03,091
President of Hensley
Financial Services since 1992,

255
00:11:03,116 --> 00:11:05,116
married to Christine since 1976...

256
00:11:05,141 --> 00:11:07,141
two adult children, three grandchildren,

257
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,166
patron of the arts.

258
00:11:09,526 --> 00:11:11,235
This guy's a model citizen.

259
00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:13,066
Yeah, except for the money laundering.

260
00:11:13,092 --> 00:11:14,846
Which he keeps meticulously separate

261
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,337
from his good name.

262
00:11:16,362 --> 00:11:18,297
We already tried to
blackmail one banker today.

263
00:11:18,322 --> 00:11:19,322
It didn't go well.

264
00:11:19,347 --> 00:11:21,781
Yes, but what about the
guards, the alarms, the cameras?

265
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,565
We don't even have time
to do proper surveillance.

266
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,009
We don't have the time to do anything else.

267
00:11:25,034 --> 00:11:26,794
We have to find the ledger, Katya.

268
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:29,151
It's our only shot at
turning this against the SVR

269
00:11:29,176 --> 00:11:30,177
and getting out.

270
00:11:30,202 --> 00:11:31,664
All right, we didn't drag Alex into this

271
00:11:31,689 --> 00:11:32,923
to give up now.

272
00:11:32,948 --> 00:11:34,699
We're not gonna break in.

273
00:11:34,724 --> 00:11:36,427
Did you hear anything I just said?

274
00:11:36,452 --> 00:11:38,379
We're gonna walk right
through the front door.

275
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:42,392
How?

276
00:11:42,783 --> 00:11:44,841
Tolliver.

277
00:12:00,463 --> 00:12:01,698
Screw the asterisk

278
00:12:01,723 --> 00:12:03,287
and all those steroid jackasses.

279
00:12:03,312 --> 00:12:05,935
You ask me, the home-run
record still belongs to Maris.

280
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,207
But Maris didn't draw a
single intentional walk in 1961

281
00:12:09,232 --> 00:12:11,286
because Mickey Mantle was
hitting .317 behind him.

282
00:12:11,311 --> 00:12:12,897
And then you have to factor in the dilution

283
00:12:12,922 --> 00:12:15,544
of the average pitcher quality
in the first year of expansion.

284
00:12:17,626 --> 00:12:19,576
How do you remember all this crap?

285
00:12:19,602 --> 00:12:21,553
Nice and warm in there?

286
00:12:22,869 --> 00:12:24,721
Yeah, very cozy.

287
00:12:25,025 --> 00:12:26,953
Just me and the human computer.

288
00:12:26,978 --> 00:12:27,768
What do you got?

289
00:12:27,793 --> 00:12:29,584
The girl at the club wasn't lying.

290
00:12:29,609 --> 00:12:30,986
Judging from the two guys

291
00:12:31,011 --> 00:12:32,460
with blue fingers smoking out back,

292
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,490
we just found our counterfeiting operation.

293
00:12:34,516 --> 00:12:36,451
Nice work, O'Connor.

294
00:12:36,476 --> 00:12:38,928
We still don't know if Zhulov's been here.

295
00:12:39,837 --> 00:12:42,583
That girl's passport was
the best I've ever seen.

296
00:12:42,608 --> 00:12:44,511
Zhulov is going to need the best

297
00:12:44,537 --> 00:12:45,867
if he's gonna get out of this country.

298
00:12:45,892 --> 00:12:47,480
What if we missed him?

299
00:12:47,505 --> 00:12:49,667
It's only been a few hours
since he left the airport.

300
00:12:49,691 --> 00:12:51,033
There's no way they could turn around

301
00:12:51,058 --> 00:12:52,352
a quality passport that fast.

302
00:12:52,377 --> 00:12:54,366
We go in, we flip who's
ever running the place,

303
00:12:54,391 --> 00:12:56,151
find out what they know about Zhulov.

304
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:56,879
What?

305
00:12:56,904 --> 00:12:59,086
News travels fast in the Russian community.

306
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,475
If we bust this place,
Zhulov will never be back.

307
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,875
If they're making his passport,

308
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,327
then they'll have his picture.

309
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:06,852
If we can get eyes inside,

310
00:13:06,877 --> 00:13:08,132
we can confirm he's coming back.

311
00:13:08,157 --> 00:13:09,561
Are you saying we walk right in

312
00:13:09,586 --> 00:13:11,096
with a bunch of Russian
counterfeiters in the back?

313
00:13:11,121 --> 00:13:12,351
No.

314
00:13:12,377 --> 00:13:14,697
I'm saying we don't have to.

315
00:13:16,641 --> 00:13:18,624
_

316
00:13:24,505 --> 00:13:26,609
So we had to pick one of
the Greek philosophers...

317
00:13:26,634 --> 00:13:28,257
Classical or pre-Socratic?

318
00:13:28,281 --> 00:13:31,144
Um... I did Aristotle.

319
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,212
- Classical.
- Sure.

320
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:34,860
Anyway, we were supposed to say

321
00:13:34,885 --> 00:13:37,511
how that philosopher's
ideas still applies to, like,

322
00:13:37,536 --> 00:13:38,269
our lives today.

323
00:13:38,294 --> 00:13:39,294
Hello. Is everything all right?

324
00:13:39,334 --> 00:13:40,641
So mine was a tragic hero, which is, like,

325
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,442
someone who's not bad, but they
just make a really big mistake,

326
00:13:43,467 --> 00:13:44,586
and it ruins their life.

327
00:13:44,612 --> 00:13:45,723
For you or for the patient?

328
00:13:45,747 --> 00:13:48,418
And I chose Heath Ledger,
because he wasn't a bad person.

329
00:13:48,443 --> 00:13:50,348
I mean, they were prescription drugs.

330
00:13:50,373 --> 00:13:52,139
Okay, yes, I'll be right there.

331
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,227
And she gave me a B-plus

332
00:13:54,252 --> 00:13:56,194
because she said I used
too many online sources.

333
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,681
That's fantastic, honey.

334
00:13:58,514 --> 00:13:59,543
It... it is?

335
00:13:59,568 --> 00:14:00,754
Mark, what are you talking about?

336
00:14:00,786 --> 00:14:01,786
She said she got a B.

337
00:14:01,811 --> 00:14:02,742
B-plus.

338
00:14:02,767 --> 00:14:04,891
And we live in the Internet age.

339
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,805
Online sources are part of modern life.

340
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:07,422
You're right.

341
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:08,899
I'm sorry. Listen to your mother.

342
00:14:08,924 --> 00:14:10,993
- Everything okay at work?
- No, it's fine.

343
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:14,634
This is why you need to show me
your work before you turn it in.

344
00:14:14,658 --> 00:14:15,235
Please.

345
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,187
Okay.

346
00:14:20,053 --> 00:14:22,053
Natalie?

347
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:24,380
Yeah, she's fine, but we
have to get back to her.

348
00:14:42,303 --> 00:14:43,947
Well, so much for insulation.

349
00:14:43,971 --> 00:14:45,971
About a dozen building code violations

350
00:14:45,996 --> 00:14:47,586
between this floor and that ceiling.

351
00:14:47,612 --> 00:14:50,292
The Russian mob's not much
for building codes, go figure.

352
00:14:50,874 --> 00:14:52,021
Is that a problem?

353
00:14:52,046 --> 00:14:54,350
Problem? It's a godsend.

354
00:14:56,826 --> 00:14:58,826
All right, a little to the right.

355
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,505
My right.

356
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,825
Did you bring his ball?

357
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,445
How did men end up in charge of the world?

358
00:15:06,931 --> 00:15:08,931
Muscle mass.

359
00:15:35,756 --> 00:15:37,756
All right, video feed transmitting.

360
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:39,697
If one of those passports is for Zhulov,

361
00:15:39,722 --> 00:15:40,722
we'll catch his face.

362
00:15:40,747 --> 00:15:42,555
Sound?

363
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,603
Let's get out of here.

364
00:16:00,303 --> 00:16:02,303
Where are the guards stationed?

365
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,100
- Depends.
- Ow!

366
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,282
You trying to leave a scar?

367
00:16:05,307 --> 00:16:06,542
Where are the guards?

368
00:16:06,567 --> 00:16:08,982
They patrol. There's two.

369
00:16:09,007 --> 00:16:10,839
One always circling the ground floor.

370
00:16:10,865 --> 00:16:12,169
And there are cameras all over.

371
00:16:12,193 --> 00:16:13,376
Cameras won't be an issue.

372
00:16:13,401 --> 00:16:14,894
You forgot something at the office.

373
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:16,537
You want me to go in there?

374
00:16:16,562 --> 00:16:19,406
You work there. You have legitimate access.

375
00:16:19,431 --> 00:16:20,622
Much less suspicious.

376
00:16:20,648 --> 00:16:22,215
Are you people insane?

377
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,894
What if someone sees me?

378
00:16:24,334 --> 00:16:26,125
You made me call in sick, remember?

379
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,475
You made a fast recovery.

380
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,436
And you don't really have a choice.

381
00:16:30,686 --> 00:16:32,763
You guys are gonna kill me, aren't you?

382
00:16:32,789 --> 00:16:35,148
Once you get what you want.

383
00:16:35,507 --> 00:16:38,212
Do it now, then. Get it over with.

384
00:16:38,237 --> 00:16:40,219
Shut up and listen to me carefully.

385
00:16:40,244 --> 00:16:42,244
As long as you do what we tell you to do,

386
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:44,054
no one gets hurt.

387
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,079
But let me be clear.

388
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,280
If you touch my daughter again,

389
00:16:49,305 --> 00:16:51,638
I will definitely kill you.

390
00:16:52,772 --> 00:16:54,772
Okay?

391
00:16:54,905 --> 00:16:56,723
I promise I won't.

392
00:16:56,748 --> 00:16:58,748
It's all very simple, Scott.

393
00:16:58,913 --> 00:17:00,913
You get in, you get the ledger,

394
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:02,670
you get out, we all go home.

395
00:17:02,695 --> 00:17:05,087
You'll be back to chasing tail by sunrise.

396
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,515
_

397
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:33,342
This is such a bad idea.

398
00:17:33,367 --> 00:17:34,890
Please don't talk.

399
00:17:34,915 --> 00:17:36,915
I'm nervous. I talk when I'm nervous.

400
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:37,940
Which way?

401
00:17:37,965 --> 00:17:40,514
Just follow me.

402
00:17:44,514 --> 00:17:46,514
This one.

403
00:18:01,217 --> 00:18:02,217
Stay here.

404
00:18:02,242 --> 00:18:03,684
Watch for anyone coming.

405
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,451
Is that the cabinet?

406
00:18:05,476 --> 00:18:06,476
Top drawer.

407
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,850
What, you have a hardware store in there?

408
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,875
Watch the door.

409
00:18:33,358 --> 00:18:34,358
Damn.

410
00:18:34,383 --> 00:18:35,077
What's wrong?

411
00:18:35,102 --> 00:18:36,700
Didn't catch.

412
00:18:36,725 --> 00:18:39,428
- What didn't catch?
- Stop talking.

413
00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:47,320
Come on, baby.

414
00:18:47,345 --> 00:18:48,872
Come on, baby.

415
00:18:49,858 --> 00:18:51,680
Yes.

416
00:19:03,858 --> 00:19:04,858
Hurry up.

417
00:19:04,883 --> 00:19:06,840
I'm going as fast as I can.

418
00:19:10,928 --> 00:19:12,622
Oh, God!

419
00:19:12,647 --> 00:19:14,558
Someone's coming.

420
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,787
Why would you close the door, you idiot?

421
00:19:16,812 --> 00:19:18,541
Now they'll definitely know we're in here.

422
00:19:18,566 --> 00:19:19,501
What do we do?

423
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:21,856
Take off your pants.

424
00:19:23,397 --> 00:19:25,140
Hello.

425
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:26,620
Mr. Yates, sir!

426
00:19:30,157 --> 00:19:31,399
Mr. Tolliver?

427
00:19:31,399 --> 00:19:32,541
Oh, man!

428
00:19:32,566 --> 00:19:33,472
Oh, Jerry.

429
00:19:33,497 --> 00:19:34,497
It's Jeff.

430
00:19:34,522 --> 00:19:36,374
What are you doing in Mr. Yates' office?

431
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:38,072
This isn't your office?

432
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,320
Look, Jeff,

433
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,616
if I'm gonna be totally honest with you.

434
00:19:42,822 --> 00:19:47,560
My lady friend, she's
a huge fan of Van Gogh.

435
00:19:47,585 --> 00:19:49,312
She's never seen an original.

436
00:19:49,338 --> 00:19:50,728
And I've never seen her naked.

437
00:19:50,753 --> 00:19:52,929
Scott, what the hell? I can't believe this.

438
00:19:53,274 --> 00:19:55,274
Could we at least give her a moment

439
00:19:55,299 --> 00:19:57,936
to put herself back together, huh?

440
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:15,079
Maybe we could not mention
this to the big guy?

441
00:20:20,329 --> 00:20:22,818
You're a prince, Jerry.

442
00:20:27,546 --> 00:20:29,936
That'll work.

443
00:20:30,984 --> 00:20:32,746
I want to go home.

444
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:34,664
Now!

445
00:20:34,689 --> 00:20:36,280
I'll turn it around in the car.

446
00:20:41,945 --> 00:20:43,665
You owe me 800 bucks.

447
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,470
And you owe me a new blouse.

448
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:46,708
You're the one who ripped it open.

449
00:20:46,733 --> 00:20:48,716
I'm also the one who just saved your ass.

450
00:20:48,741 --> 00:20:50,741
I can't even write it off.

451
00:20:50,766 --> 00:20:51,421
What?

452
00:20:51,445 --> 00:20:52,812
The 800 bucks.

453
00:20:53,399 --> 00:20:55,079
What?

454
00:20:55,104 --> 00:20:56,555
I just... I don't know.

455
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,580
You kidnapped me,

456
00:20:57,605 --> 00:20:59,605
which is totally "dickish"
on so many levels.

457
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,555
But in some strange way,
I don't want it to end.

458
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:04,484
It's called "Stockholm Syndrome," jackass.

459
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,499
How did you get to be so
rich without an education?

460
00:21:07,524 --> 00:21:09,524
Look, I just want to say I like you.

461
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:12,329
Once you get past the punching,
abduction, and blackmail,

462
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,929
you seem like a good person.

463
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,685
Under a different circumstance,

464
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,710
I definitely would bone you.

465
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:20,269
Wow. That was beautiful.

466
00:21:20,294 --> 00:21:22,743
Come on, we'll tell our
grandchildren this story.

467
00:21:22,768 --> 00:21:25,102
You tell anybody that
story, and the Torreon Cartel

468
00:21:25,127 --> 00:21:27,127
gets a call about your extracurriculars.

469
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:28,976
Hey, relax. I was kidding.

470
00:21:29,001 --> 00:21:30,536
I promise I won't say anything...

471
00:21:30,561 --> 00:21:31,561
to anyone.

472
00:21:31,586 --> 00:21:34,230
Hmm. Good-bye, Scott.

473
00:21:35,281 --> 00:21:37,406
Good-bye, Natalie.

474
00:21:38,758 --> 00:21:40,615
Hello, Natalie.

475
00:21:44,758 --> 00:21:46,156
Victor...

476
00:21:46,182 --> 00:21:49,182
Get in. We're going to go for a ride.

477
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:06,928
She should have been back by now.

478
00:22:06,953 --> 00:22:09,105
Things come up. Natalie can handle herself.

479
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:10,791
You keep saying everything's
going to be fine,

480
00:22:10,816 --> 00:22:12,198
but everything keeps getting worse.

481
00:22:12,223 --> 00:22:15,619
Alex, I know these last few
days have been very hard for you.

482
00:22:15,645 --> 00:22:17,528
You mean the part where
you're Russian spies,

483
00:22:17,553 --> 00:22:19,830
the part where I sabotage my entire career

484
00:22:19,855 --> 00:22:21,159
in front of a federal judge,

485
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:23,872
or the part where we kidnapped
a man and broke into a bank?

486
00:22:23,897 --> 00:22:26,268
What if she was arrested or hurt?

487
00:22:28,362 --> 00:22:29,900
It's mine. It's work.

488
00:22:29,926 --> 00:22:30,926
Hello?

489
00:22:30,951 --> 00:22:32,573
O'Connor, get in here.

490
00:22:32,598 --> 00:22:34,298
We found Zhulov.

491
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:36,099
I have to go.

492
00:22:36,074 --> 00:22:38,708
No, no, Alex, Alex. You
can't go in like this.

493
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:40,177
- Like what?
- Upset.

494
00:22:40,202 --> 00:22:41,601
If they see that you're stressed,

495
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:42,899
someone will start asking questions.

496
00:22:42,924 --> 00:22:44,121
I am stressed.

497
00:22:44,146 --> 00:22:45,895
Okay, channel it.

498
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:49,114
Natalie could be dead.

499
00:22:49,139 --> 00:22:50,075
Alex.

500
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:52,489
Natalie will be fine.

501
00:22:53,192 --> 00:22:54,590
Just...

502
00:22:54,794 --> 00:22:56,535
call me when you hear from her.

503
00:23:00,418 --> 00:23:02,091
We shouldn't have let her go alone.

504
00:23:02,116 --> 00:23:04,170
Natalie knows what she's
doing. You said it yourself.

505
00:23:04,194 --> 00:23:05,678
I said that for Alex.

506
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:07,990
Where is she?

507
00:23:30,805 --> 00:23:32,805
There were cameras in there.

508
00:23:32,992 --> 00:23:35,678
They're gonna find the body
and come looking for me.

509
00:23:35,703 --> 00:23:38,230
I handled the cameras.

510
00:23:43,469 --> 00:23:45,469
I can explain everything.

511
00:23:45,766 --> 00:23:47,765
Please just listen to me.

512
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,790
_

513
00:23:58,718 --> 00:24:00,663
You killed me!

514
00:24:01,813 --> 00:24:04,099
You put a bullet in my head.

515
00:24:04,124 --> 00:24:05,303
Just let me explain.

516
00:24:05,328 --> 00:24:07,107
Do you have any idea how
much I've done for you,

517
00:24:07,132 --> 00:24:08,676
for your family...

518
00:24:08,701 --> 00:24:10,100
the risks I took?

519
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:13,069
And all the time, you were lying to me.

520
00:24:13,094 --> 00:24:15,196
In my bed and lying to me!

521
00:24:15,221 --> 00:24:17,053
I can explain everything.

522
00:24:17,078 --> 00:24:18,290
Who are you?

523
00:24:18,399 --> 00:24:19,943
Are you CIA?

524
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,663
No!

525
00:24:20,688 --> 00:24:22,198
Who are you working for?

526
00:24:22,223 --> 00:24:24,223
My family, it's just us.

527
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:32,936
We have to stop Black Dagger.

528
00:24:32,961 --> 00:24:35,665
It's worse than you know.

529
00:24:42,758 --> 00:24:44,912
It'll change everything.

530
00:24:49,977 --> 00:24:51,154
Look familiar?

531
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:52,763
Our good friend Oleg Zhulov.

532
00:24:52,788 --> 00:24:55,247
Or should I say, "Alain Ducat"?

533
00:24:55,272 --> 00:24:57,272
Two hours ago, we intercepted a call

534
00:24:57,297 --> 00:24:58,574
between one of the counterfeiters

535
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:01,236
and a customer we
believe to be Oleg Zhulov.

536
00:25:01,261 --> 00:25:02,261
They're arranging a meet,

537
00:25:02,286 --> 00:25:03,286
7:00 a.m. at Brighton Playground.

538
00:25:03,311 --> 00:25:04,915
We're gonna pick up Zhulov then.

539
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,084
Quick and quiet.

540
00:25:06,109 --> 00:25:08,109
Russians can't know, PD can't know,

541
00:25:08,134 --> 00:25:09,804
because if PD knows, Russians will know.

542
00:25:09,829 --> 00:25:12,036
So we're grabbing an SVR
officer off the street...

543
00:25:12,061 --> 00:25:13,668
in Little Odessa...

544
00:25:13,693 --> 00:25:15,364
without Russians knowing?

545
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:17,108
What could go wrong?

546
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:29,022
Half-mile blast radius...

547
00:25:30,711 --> 00:25:32,711
that's a lot of people.

548
00:25:32,736 --> 00:25:34,907
You sure about this?

549
00:25:35,109 --> 00:25:36,837
About what?

550
00:25:38,797 --> 00:25:40,898
When it's gonna happen?

551
00:25:40,922 --> 00:25:42,628
Where it's gonna happen?

552
00:25:42,654 --> 00:25:44,685
No.

553
00:25:45,609 --> 00:25:46,844
But it was in the laptop

554
00:25:46,869 --> 00:25:50,413
the SVR was willing to kill
anyone, anywhere to get.

555
00:25:53,383 --> 00:25:56,513
When you said you wanted to run away...

556
00:25:58,117 --> 00:26:00,117
it was about this?

557
00:26:02,429 --> 00:26:04,999
It was about you...

558
00:26:05,922 --> 00:26:08,436
and me...

559
00:26:08,587 --> 00:26:11,082
escaping all this...

560
00:26:11,961 --> 00:26:14,438
together.

561
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:25,328
You didn't have to kill him, you know?

562
00:26:25,353 --> 00:26:27,228
Tolliver.

563
00:26:28,961 --> 00:26:31,671
He was a coked-up party boy.

564
00:26:32,219 --> 00:26:35,707
He never would have been
able to keep his mouth shut.

565
00:26:46,774 --> 00:26:48,774
All right, we have a visual
on the counterfeiter...

566
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,388
on the bench, male, 50s,

567
00:26:51,413 --> 00:26:53,092
black coat, reading the newspaper.

568
00:26:53,116 --> 00:26:54,884
Just waiting for Zhulov.

569
00:26:55,399 --> 00:26:57,569
Alpha team in position. Bravo team?

570
00:26:57,594 --> 00:26:58,892
Bravo in position.

571
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:01,570
I'm trying to remember what
it's like to feel my hands.

572
00:27:01,595 --> 00:27:03,093
Do you want my gloves? I can't...

573
00:27:03,118 --> 00:27:04,037
Charlie team?

574
00:27:04,062 --> 00:27:05,460
Charlie in position.

575
00:27:05,485 --> 00:27:06,644
Don't do that.

576
00:27:06,669 --> 00:27:07,893
Do what?

577
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:09,996
Don't stop talking when you hear the radio.

578
00:27:10,021 --> 00:27:12,729
That's how surveillance teams get made.

579
00:27:12,754 --> 00:27:15,573
We're just two regular
people walking and talking.

580
00:27:15,598 --> 00:27:16,941
You doing okay?

581
00:27:16,966 --> 00:27:18,181
Right now?

582
00:27:18,206 --> 00:27:19,478
In general.

583
00:27:19,503 --> 00:27:20,958
Why do you ask?

584
00:27:20,983 --> 00:27:23,742
Something regular people
ask each other, Alex.

585
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,373
And also, you're jumpy as hell.

586
00:27:26,657 --> 00:27:28,657
I'm fine.

587
00:27:29,867 --> 00:27:31,866
We got a visual on the target.

588
00:27:31,891 --> 00:27:33,709
West of you, Charlie.

589
00:27:35,577 --> 00:27:38,663
Don't look.

590
00:27:50,391 --> 00:27:52,873
They're making the exchange.

591
00:27:53,141 --> 00:27:55,429
Zhulov has a package.

592
00:27:55,547 --> 00:27:57,702
Moving on the target.

593
00:28:06,743 --> 00:28:08,930
Know her?

594
00:28:10,031 --> 00:28:12,865
She's with Zhulov.

595
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,481
One of the passport photos at the market...

596
00:28:14,506 --> 00:28:15,642
it was her.

597
00:28:19,711 --> 00:28:21,170
She's going for the van.

598
00:28:21,195 --> 00:28:22,698
Alpha team, you are blown.

599
00:28:22,723 --> 00:28:24,310
Blonde female, approaching your six.

600
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:25,335
Gun!

601
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,531
Get down!

602
00:28:28,571 --> 00:28:30,148
He's running.

603
00:28:30,173 --> 00:28:31,716
Target's moving, northwest.

604
00:28:51,024 --> 00:28:53,140
So much for a quiet pickup, huh?

605
00:29:09,444 --> 00:29:10,886
You all right?

606
00:29:10,911 --> 00:29:12,680
Where have you been?

607
00:29:16,008 --> 00:29:19,214
All right, already. I was working.

608
00:29:19,414 --> 00:29:21,414
What's the big deal?

609
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:25,589
Oh, yes, I forgot that
you had that project.

610
00:29:25,614 --> 00:29:27,102
You guys are nuts, and I'm starving.

611
00:29:27,127 --> 00:29:28,414
Want to get some breakfast?

612
00:29:28,843 --> 00:29:31,503
Yeah, let's do that.

613
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:33,424
Natalie, where are we going?

614
00:29:33,449 --> 00:29:34,449
What's going on?

615
00:29:34,474 --> 00:29:36,071
It was Victor, wasn't it?

616
00:29:36,096 --> 00:29:37,976
I'm going to kill him.
I'm going to do it myself.

617
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:42,218
Mom, stop.

618
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:45,204
How did you get into my house?

619
00:29:45,229 --> 00:29:46,505
I had to do my job, Katya.

620
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:47,843
You know that.

621
00:29:47,868 --> 00:29:49,340
You're on his side?

622
00:29:49,365 --> 00:29:50,831
He's on our side.

623
00:29:51,058 --> 00:29:52,184
He knows.

624
00:29:52,209 --> 00:29:53,458
Knows what?

625
00:29:53,744 --> 00:29:55,744
Everything.

626
00:29:55,769 --> 00:29:57,470
You trust him, Natalie?

627
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:59,891
If I wasn't on your side,
you'd already be dead?

628
00:30:00,699 --> 00:30:02,699
According to the ledger,

629
00:30:02,724 --> 00:30:04,724
the money for Black Dagger
will end up in Italy,

630
00:30:04,749 --> 00:30:07,252
in the hands of the operator
who will execute the operation.

631
00:30:07,277 --> 00:30:08,277
Italy?

632
00:30:08,302 --> 00:30:10,302
A lot of international
money floating around,

633
00:30:10,327 --> 00:30:12,328
pervasive corruption
in the banking system...

634
00:30:12,353 --> 00:30:15,352
it's a convenient combination.

635
00:30:15,377 --> 00:30:18,377
The transfers arrive at a
bank in Rome in three days.

636
00:30:18,402 --> 00:30:21,184
Someone must be there to
identify who picks it up.

637
00:30:21,209 --> 00:30:22,948
Identify or kill?

638
00:30:23,003 --> 00:30:25,003
_

639
00:30:25,028 --> 00:30:26,766
Well, Katya and I are on
the next plane to Rome.

640
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:27,649
Don't be ridiculous.

641
00:30:27,674 --> 00:30:28,962
The Rezident would know you're gone

642
00:30:28,987 --> 00:30:30,511
before you made it to the airport,

643
00:30:30,536 --> 00:30:32,017
same with Natalie...

644
00:30:33,306 --> 00:30:35,832
which is why we're sending Alex.

645
00:30:35,857 --> 00:30:36,857
What?

646
00:30:36,882 --> 00:30:37,702
I'm his handler.

647
00:30:37,727 --> 00:30:39,403
I inform the Rezident of his movements.

648
00:30:39,428 --> 00:30:40,428
I can hide them as well.

649
00:30:40,453 --> 00:30:42,862
No, no, no. He's an analyst.

650
00:30:42,887 --> 00:30:46,313
He's not ready to operate,
not alone in a foreign country.

651
00:30:46,338 --> 00:30:47,693
You'll have to teach him quickly.

652
00:30:47,718 --> 00:30:50,387
_

653
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:52,826
_

654
00:30:52,906 --> 00:30:55,225
_

655
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,571
If we can't get Alex to Rome,

656
00:30:56,596 --> 00:30:58,190
we lose the trail on Black Dagger,

657
00:30:58,215 --> 00:30:59,822
and it's the only trail we have.

658
00:30:59,847 --> 00:31:01,376
What about the CIA?

659
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,552
He can't just disappear
from the task force.

660
00:31:03,577 --> 00:31:05,472
He won't have to if they go with him.

661
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:07,265
How do you plan on pulling that off?

662
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:09,712
This morning, the task force took down

663
00:31:09,737 --> 00:31:12,081
an SVR officer named Oleg Zhulov.

664
00:31:12,106 --> 00:31:14,106
It was messy.

665
00:31:14,214 --> 00:31:16,018
We can use that.

666
00:31:16,043 --> 00:31:18,773
I want the bugs out of my house today.

667
00:31:21,948 --> 00:31:24,242
Well, it wasn't pretty, but we got Zhulov.

668
00:31:24,267 --> 00:31:25,917
I got to start my paperwork.

669
00:31:25,942 --> 00:31:27,133
She was gonna kill him.

670
00:31:27,158 --> 00:31:28,956
It was clean.

671
00:31:30,019 --> 00:31:32,390
Removing the body from the
scene, on the other hand,

672
00:31:32,415 --> 00:31:34,069
that's a one-way ticket to DOJ hell.

673
00:31:34,094 --> 00:31:36,185
Leaving it there wouldn't
have exactly been covert.

674
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:37,690
Anyway, we took her to a hospital.

675
00:31:37,715 --> 00:31:39,377
Except she was already dead.

676
00:31:39,402 --> 00:31:42,402
Unless I detected a
weak pulse at the scene.

677
00:31:42,427 --> 00:31:44,427
That would change things.

678
00:31:49,581 --> 00:31:50,857
Natalie?

679
00:31:50,882 --> 00:31:51,882
She's fine.

680
00:31:51,907 --> 00:31:52,657
What happened?

681
00:31:52,682 --> 00:31:54,445
I promise I'll explain everything,

682
00:31:54,469 --> 00:31:56,469
but right now you've got to listen to me.

683
00:31:56,494 --> 00:31:59,360
This morning, your task
force took down Oleg Zhulov

684
00:31:59,385 --> 00:32:00,681
and killed a woman who was with him.

685
00:32:00,707 --> 00:32:01,906
How do you know that?

686
00:32:01,931 --> 00:32:03,270
They're gonna run her fingerprints

687
00:32:03,295 --> 00:32:06,295
to find out who she was,
her name, her address.

688
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,320
You've got to get both of those
to us as soon as you can, Alex.

689
00:32:09,345 --> 00:32:10,317
What? Why?

690
00:32:10,342 --> 00:32:13,094
We need to get to her
place before the FBI does.

691
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,882
You got to trust me on this.

692
00:32:18,706 --> 00:32:21,283
Alex, do you understand me?

693
00:32:21,308 --> 00:32:23,080
I have to go.

694
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,620
I know nothing.

695
00:32:28,645 --> 00:32:30,383
You're an SVR major.

696
00:32:30,408 --> 00:32:33,767
You told another SVR
officer, Irina Semovetskaya,

697
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,880
that the SVR was planning an attack.

698
00:32:36,135 --> 00:32:39,558
I was trying to get laid, as you say.

699
00:32:40,113 --> 00:32:42,113
Well, that will never happen.

700
00:32:42,323 --> 00:32:45,797
Irina is dead.

701
00:32:46,075 --> 00:32:49,303
An SVR team introduced
her to the hood of a truck,

702
00:32:49,328 --> 00:32:51,035
and you were trying to get
out of town pretty quick,

703
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,060
weren't you, Oleg?

704
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:54,081
Why the hurry?

705
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:56,105
What are you running away from?

706
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:02,050
I know nothing, same as you.

707
00:33:17,808 --> 00:33:19,699
I made you when I left the building.

708
00:33:19,724 --> 00:33:21,097
No, you didn't.

709
00:33:21,121 --> 00:33:23,667
I could've done whatever I wanted to you.

710
00:33:24,557 --> 00:33:26,421
You still can.

711
00:33:26,446 --> 00:33:28,274
Do we keep playing like this,

712
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:29,547
or do you want to just speak plainly?

713
00:33:29,572 --> 00:33:30,790
You want plain? Okay.

714
00:33:30,815 --> 00:33:32,761
If you ever come into my house again

715
00:33:32,786 --> 00:33:35,509
to put more surveillance, I will kill you.

716
00:33:35,534 --> 00:33:37,463
And I don't care about the consequences.

717
00:33:37,488 --> 00:33:39,439
I didn't set foot in your house.

718
00:33:39,464 --> 00:33:41,752
An SVR team, then, on your order.

719
00:33:41,777 --> 00:33:44,343
You think I'm kidding?

720
00:33:46,182 --> 00:33:48,182
Sarah's boyfriend did it.

721
00:33:48,207 --> 00:33:49,391
Sarah doesn't have a boyfriend.

722
00:33:49,416 --> 00:33:52,693
He's 18. He drinks alcohol.

723
00:33:52,719 --> 00:33:54,785
He cheats on her.

724
00:33:59,199 --> 00:34:00,199
That's not her.

725
00:34:00,224 --> 00:34:02,048
If you overreact and confront her about it,

726
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:04,174
you will achieve the exact
opposite of what you want.

727
00:34:04,199 --> 00:34:06,524
Don't tell me how to parent...

728
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:08,307
If you forbid her to see him,

729
00:34:08,332 --> 00:34:10,427
it will only drive her to him.

730
00:34:10,453 --> 00:34:13,189
I'm speaking from experience.

731
00:34:14,113 --> 00:34:16,113
Go home, Katya.

732
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:18,466
We'll finish encrypting the drive soon.

733
00:34:20,144 --> 00:34:23,144
And your hollow threats to kill me...

734
00:34:23,574 --> 00:34:25,574
they make you sound weak.

735
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:32,497
Just try me.

736
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:44,716
Are you okay?

737
00:34:44,926 --> 00:34:46,926
I killed someone.

738
00:34:47,443 --> 00:34:50,059
You saved my life.

739
00:34:51,136 --> 00:34:53,136
That helps a little, I guess.

740
00:34:53,161 --> 00:34:55,160
We just ID'd Zhulov's
deceased lady friend...

741
00:34:55,185 --> 00:34:58,712
Svetlana Karaseva, suspected Russian mafia,

742
00:34:58,737 --> 00:35:00,144
address in Bensonhurst.

743
00:35:00,168 --> 00:35:01,871
Let's go.

744
00:35:06,589 --> 00:35:08,589
The drive.

745
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,970
Alex got the address.

746
00:35:14,995 --> 00:35:18,107
Bensonhurst... the task force is
heading out. We'll beat them there.

747
00:35:18,131 --> 00:35:19,539
Tell Alex to slow them down.

748
00:35:19,564 --> 00:35:20,883
Okay.

749
00:36:36,829 --> 00:36:38,707
They're here. Get out.

750
00:36:39,107 --> 00:36:40,674
I can't just leave it by the door.

751
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,246
Our whole plan is riding on this.

752
00:36:42,271 --> 00:36:44,154
If it's gonna get Alex
to Rome, it has to sell.

753
00:36:44,179 --> 00:36:45,077
Natalia, now.

754
00:37:22,424 --> 00:37:24,362
How many units are in this building?

755
00:37:24,387 --> 00:37:26,128
What, are you in the market?

756
00:37:26,153 --> 00:37:29,972
No, it's just... that's a lot of keys.

757
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,175
Who leaves a window open in March?

758
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,074
They probably heard us coming.

759
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:21,073
Nothing.

760
00:38:21,486 --> 00:38:23,847
Tear this place apart.

761
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,147
Anything?

762
00:38:37,172 --> 00:38:38,780
Not yet.

763
00:38:44,878 --> 00:38:47,490
Look what we have here.

764
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:03,637
Well, that was anticlimactic.

765
00:39:03,662 --> 00:39:05,813
Uh, the lining.

766
00:39:19,011 --> 00:39:21,693
Now we're getting somewhere.

767
00:39:41,699 --> 00:39:43,699
The documents on the flash
drive you found at the apartment

768
00:39:43,699 --> 00:39:45,433
were SVR encrypted.

769
00:39:45,458 --> 00:39:47,443
Fortunately, the CIA has had the cipher

770
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,147
for that particular
encryption for eight months.

771
00:39:49,181 --> 00:39:50,830
The drive contained a
communiqué from Russia.

772
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:53,699
According to the New York
Rezident, Genady Isakov,

773
00:39:53,699 --> 00:39:55,316
the SVR believes Mikhail

774
00:39:55,341 --> 00:39:57,341
passed the stoles files to a third party.

775
00:39:57,366 --> 00:39:58,504
- Who?
- A broker.

776
00:39:58,528 --> 00:40:00,216
Mikhail was trying to sell
them on the open market.

777
00:40:00,241 --> 00:40:02,103
Looks like Vasso picked
the wrong guy to trust.

778
00:40:02,128 --> 00:40:03,674
So Zhulov was looking for the Egg, too.

779
00:40:03,699 --> 00:40:05,699
Where's his broker?

780
00:40:05,699 --> 00:40:07,663
Rome, Italy.

781
00:40:12,167 --> 00:40:14,822
I have to admit, it was
smart using an encryption code

782
00:40:14,847 --> 00:40:16,674
you knew the CIA had already broken.

783
00:40:16,699 --> 00:40:17,994
What I don't understand

784
00:40:18,019 --> 00:40:20,121
is why send the task force
halfway around the world

785
00:40:20,145 --> 00:40:22,145
chasing files that
don't even exist anymore?

786
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,644
The money from Tolliver's bank's
going to Rome in three days.

787
00:40:24,669 --> 00:40:26,669
We needed to figure out
a way to get you there.

788
00:40:26,699 --> 00:40:29,357
This whole operation is
supposed to be off-book!

789
00:40:29,472 --> 00:40:31,674
Now you're dragging the task force into it?

790
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:34,199
And you just decided to
send me to Italy alone

791
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:35,674
without even talking to me first?

792
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:36,599
There wasn't time.

793
00:40:36,624 --> 00:40:38,143
And it wasn't our call.

794
00:40:38,674 --> 00:40:41,145
What are you talking about?
Whose call was it, then?

795
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:42,960
Mine.

796
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:49,568
It's nice to finally meet you, Alex.

797
