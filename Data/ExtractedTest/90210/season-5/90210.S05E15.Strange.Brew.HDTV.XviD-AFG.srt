1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
Previously on 90210...

2
00:00:05,261 --> 00:00:06,593
That was actually pretty great.

3
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:08,162
I own a music label.

4
00:00:08,164 --> 00:00:09,881
Are you saying you can make me a star?

5
00:00:09,883 --> 00:00:11,633
Annie and I have a half brother

6
00:00:11,635 --> 00:00:13,668
who was given up for
adoption before we were born.

7
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,154
What make you think you can even
find this person in the first place?

8
00:00:16,156 --> 00:00:18,022
Because I already did; he's right here.

9
00:00:18,024 --> 00:00:20,391
ANNIE: He's our half brother?

10
00:00:20,393 --> 00:00:21,476
I talked Naomi into letting me have

11
00:00:21,478 --> 00:00:23,561
her brother's old food truck.

12
00:00:23,563 --> 00:00:24,812
We could do something awesome.

13
00:00:24,814 --> 00:00:26,614
If... you want to be my partner.

14
00:00:26,616 --> 00:00:27,565
Yeah.

15
00:00:27,567 --> 00:00:28,533
Welcome to Armitage Books.

16
00:00:28,615 --> 00:00:29,781
Your blog has a real shot

17
00:00:29,783 --> 00:00:33,234
of finding the audience that it deserves.

18
00:00:35,154 --> 00:00:38,289
♪

19
00:00:42,611 --> 00:00:43,778
Look at us.

20
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,413
Between cooking meals and housework,

21
00:00:45,415 --> 00:00:46,914
we're like an old married couple.

22
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:47,999
(chuckles)

23
00:00:47,951 --> 00:00:49,283
Pretty soon we're going to be arguing about

24
00:00:49,285 --> 00:00:50,918
copper plumbing and area rugs.

25
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,120
(laughing)

26
00:00:52,122 --> 00:00:56,090
Oh, this one's still a little dirty, honey.

27
00:00:57,459 --> 00:00:59,043
Maybe I like it dirty.

28
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,688
(breathing heavily)

29
00:01:22,985 --> 00:01:25,269
- Liam, this is so wrong.
- I know.

30
00:01:25,271 --> 00:01:27,822
Why doesn't peanut butter
need to be refrigerated?

31
00:01:27,824 --> 00:01:29,323
What?

32
00:01:29,325 --> 00:01:31,442
Well, you know, most stuff just
says, "refrigerate after opening."

33
00:01:31,444 --> 00:01:32,994
Peanut butter doesn't say that.

34
00:01:32,996 --> 00:01:34,328
Which is weird, huh?

35
00:01:36,982 --> 00:01:38,166
You okay?

36
00:01:38,168 --> 00:01:40,251
Yeah, yeah.

37
00:01:40,253 --> 00:01:42,920
I... I just got lost in my reading.

38
00:01:42,922 --> 00:01:44,172
Oh, cool.

39
00:01:44,174 --> 00:01:45,623
Hey, if you're taking a break,

40
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:47,642
would you mind putting
some aloe on my back?

41
00:01:47,644 --> 00:01:50,061
I think I got sunburned today.

42
00:01:50,063 --> 00:01:51,262
(sighs)

43
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,347
(sighs)

44
00:01:55,184 --> 00:01:58,069
Uh, this is a mistake.

45
00:01:58,071 --> 00:02:00,104
I know, I should've worn sunscreen.

46
00:02:00,106 --> 00:02:02,139
I'm not talking about your sunburn.

47
00:02:02,141 --> 00:02:04,809
Uh, what makes you think I
was taking a break anyway?

48
00:02:04,811 --> 00:02:07,779
I was working, Liam, until you strutted in

49
00:02:07,781 --> 00:02:10,081
wearing half a wet suit,
babbling about peanut butter.

50
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:11,198
I went surfing and I got hungry.

51
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,583
What's wrong with that?

52
00:02:12,585 --> 00:02:15,670
Well, what's wrong is that
I'm trying to do something

53
00:02:15,672 --> 00:02:16,888
really important with my life,

54
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,806
and you are doing what you always do,

55
00:02:18,808 --> 00:02:20,541
which is waiting for life to happen.

56
00:02:20,543 --> 00:02:21,876
Whoa.

57
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:24,345
Look, I get that you went through a lot

58
00:02:24,347 --> 00:02:27,231
with the kidnapping and PTSD,

59
00:02:27,233 --> 00:02:30,017
but that doesn't change
the fact that you need to

60
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:31,435
figure out what you're doing
with your life that isn't,

61
00:02:31,437 --> 00:02:35,656
you know, hanging around
the house shirtless.

62
00:02:35,658 --> 00:02:38,025
So, rub your own back.

63
00:02:38,027 --> 00:02:39,493
I have some place to be.

64
00:02:51,256 --> 00:02:53,190
Hey, look who's awake.

65
00:02:53,192 --> 00:02:55,509
Hey, surrogates get to sleep in.

66
00:02:55,511 --> 00:02:56,811
It's part of the benefits package.

67
00:02:56,813 --> 00:02:58,312
Wait, you're not even pregnant yet.

68
00:02:58,314 --> 00:03:00,598
So, I'm practicing for when I am.

69
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,433
Oh, well... (laughing)

70
00:03:02,435 --> 00:03:04,769
Since I'm not pregnant, or about to be,

71
00:03:04,771 --> 00:03:06,086
- I started working on your track.
- Oh.

72
00:03:06,088 --> 00:03:07,738
Take a listen. Tell me what you think.

73
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,225
MICHAELA: * Open my eyes now... *

74
00:03:11,227 --> 00:03:12,693
There's no way that's me.

75
00:03:12,695 --> 00:03:14,061
You... you tweaked that audio.

76
00:03:14,063 --> 00:03:15,613
No, no, that's all you.

77
00:03:15,615 --> 00:03:17,148
Uh, you got some nice pipes.

78
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,317
(music stops) So, what's next?

79
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,319
Well, first, we're going to try you out

80
00:03:21,321 --> 00:03:23,120
- in front of a live audience, okay?
- Okay.

81
00:03:23,122 --> 00:03:24,906
Naomi's restaurant opens in a few days.

82
00:03:24,908 --> 00:03:25,990
You want some coffee?

83
00:03:25,992 --> 00:03:27,274
Yes, please.

84
00:03:27,276 --> 00:03:28,459
Cool. There you go.

85
00:03:28,461 --> 00:03:31,879
Then, play at a few local
clubs before your showing.

86
00:03:31,881 --> 00:03:33,381
Lay down some tracks while you're pregnant.

87
00:03:33,383 --> 00:03:36,450
And then, after the baby's here,

88
00:03:36,452 --> 00:03:37,451
we release the album.

89
00:03:37,453 --> 00:03:39,136
- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm.

90
00:03:39,138 --> 00:03:40,338
You can make all that happen?

91
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,505
Ah, hell yeah.

92
00:03:41,507 --> 00:03:43,641
Except the whole baby thing.

93
00:03:43,643 --> 00:03:45,292
Let's just leave that to Silver and Teddy.

94
00:03:45,294 --> 00:03:49,296
<i>So, what did Silver say when you told her?</i>

95
00:03:49,298 --> 00:03:50,564
I didn't.

96
00:03:50,524 --> 00:03:52,441
I thought you two talked and decided

97
00:03:52,443 --> 00:03:54,259
that you're going to do your own things?

98
00:03:54,261 --> 00:03:56,094
Yeah, but I'm guessing that Silver's idea

99
00:03:56,096 --> 00:03:58,614
of me doing my own thing
is, like, going to school

100
00:03:58,616 --> 00:04:00,933
and working at a coffee shop.

101
00:04:00,935 --> 00:04:03,535
Not riding in a tour
bus and singing in clubs.

102
00:04:03,537 --> 00:04:05,788
Yeah. Yeah, I didn't think of it like that.

103
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:06,906
Yeah.

104
00:04:06,908 --> 00:04:11,126
Look, Dixon, this music thing,

105
00:04:11,128 --> 00:04:13,379
it's so totally awesome.

106
00:04:13,381 --> 00:04:16,215
But my brother vouched for
me to get this surrogate job.

107
00:04:16,217 --> 00:04:18,550
I can't let Shane and Teddy down

108
00:04:18,552 --> 00:04:21,787
and I don't want Silver thinking that
we're sneaking around behind her back.

109
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:23,756
No, no, no, you're absolutely right.

110
00:04:23,758 --> 00:04:26,625
So, (sighs) I'll talk to
her, be up front with her.

111
00:04:26,627 --> 00:04:29,728
<i>Let her know that this is your dream.</i>

112
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,314
That your singing career will
not interfere with her baby.

113
00:04:32,316 --> 00:04:33,983
Then we'll be good.

114
00:04:33,985 --> 00:04:35,401
Thank you.

115
00:04:35,403 --> 00:04:36,819
Mm-hmm.

116
00:04:38,655 --> 00:04:40,639
Ooh, here's something
we can do with the truck.

117
00:04:40,641 --> 00:04:43,275
How about mobile pet grooming/psyching?

118
00:04:43,277 --> 00:04:44,526
Is that actually a thing?

119
00:04:44,528 --> 00:04:45,527
Not yet,

120
00:04:45,529 --> 00:04:47,947
but lots of single people have dogs.

121
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:49,331
And single people want to know

122
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,650
if they're ever going to
meet someone and fall in love.

123
00:04:51,652 --> 00:04:52,868
That's where we come in.

124
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,837
(laughing): I'm sorry.

125
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,372
At least it's better than my ideas:

126
00:04:56,374 --> 00:04:59,959
uh, mobile florist or,
ooh, traveling masseuse.

127
00:04:59,961 --> 00:05:01,760
Those aren't bad.

128
00:05:01,762 --> 00:05:03,512
What... but they're not us.

129
00:05:03,514 --> 00:05:05,664
Okay, I bought Mark's old food truck

130
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:08,434
because I wanted to stop
obsessing over the baby thing,

131
00:05:08,436 --> 00:05:10,686
but, really, I just want to find something

132
00:05:10,688 --> 00:05:13,105
that I'm able to focus on.

133
00:05:13,107 --> 00:05:14,773
Okay, well we'll keep thinking.

134
00:05:17,277 --> 00:05:19,061
(gasps)

135
00:05:19,063 --> 00:05:21,013
Ooh, a monkey truck.

136
00:05:21,015 --> 00:05:23,065
Who wouldn't love a truck full of monkeys.

137
00:05:24,284 --> 00:05:25,951
(laughing)

138
00:05:27,037 --> 00:05:28,287
Naomi.

139
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:29,655
Oh, my God.

140
00:05:29,657 --> 00:05:31,540
Naomi, what's on your legs?

141
00:05:31,542 --> 00:05:33,492
- Is that denim?
- So working-class.

142
00:05:33,494 --> 00:05:35,828
Next thing you know, she'll
be wearing scrunchies.

143
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,047
I am too tired to insult you back.

144
00:05:39,082 --> 00:05:42,718
Guys, I volunteered to
help Mark unload supplies

145
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,703
at the Offshore this morning.

146
00:05:44,705 --> 00:05:46,221
And when I get there, he practically

147
00:05:46,223 --> 00:05:48,474
forced me to unpack everything
for the restaurant opening.

148
00:05:48,476 --> 00:05:49,892
Weird.

149
00:05:49,894 --> 00:05:52,528
You'd think he'd know
"unload supplies" really means

150
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,646
hang out and get to know
your long lost sister better.

151
00:05:54,648 --> 00:05:56,598
Yeah, I know.

152
00:05:56,574 --> 00:05:57,907
I've been following him around for a week,

153
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:59,292
and I don't even know his apron size.

154
00:05:59,294 --> 00:06:01,377
Naomi, the restaurant
opens in a couple of days.

155
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:03,029
You guys haven't even
had a chance to breathe,

156
00:06:03,031 --> 00:06:04,080
much less bond.

157
00:06:04,082 --> 00:06:06,049
The whole point of doing
the restaurant thing

158
00:06:06,051 --> 00:06:08,001
was so we get to know
each other like family

159
00:06:08,003 --> 00:06:10,970
without all the crazy baggage
I have with my mom and Jen.

160
00:06:10,972 --> 00:06:13,306
We're nothing like family at all right now;

161
00:06:13,308 --> 00:06:14,590
we're co-workers.

162
00:06:14,592 --> 00:06:16,559
So, why don't you try to
get together outside of work?

163
00:06:16,561 --> 00:06:18,845
He lives in a place called Sylmar.

164
00:06:18,847 --> 00:06:20,730
I don't even know if that's in California.

165
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:24,984
Wait, why does my brother
live in a crappy apartment

166
00:06:24,986 --> 00:06:26,686
when I own an eight-bedroom mansion?

167
00:06:26,688 --> 00:06:28,321
Can you imagine how close we'd be

168
00:06:28,323 --> 00:06:29,689
if he lived right down the hall?

169
00:06:29,691 --> 00:06:31,174
I cannot hang out with you guys.

170
00:06:31,176 --> 00:06:32,608
I have to move Mark in

171
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,078
with the sister of his dreams.

172
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:40,533
(sighs)

173
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,504
Okay, my next book is going to be about

174
00:06:44,506 --> 00:06:47,590
the psychological torture of
watching someone read your work.

175
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:49,675
It's very good.

176
00:06:49,677 --> 00:06:52,095
(sighs) Uh, thank God.

177
00:06:52,097 --> 00:06:57,016
It's sexy and real and surprising.

178
00:06:57,018 --> 00:06:59,469
That twist where Annabelle fantasizes

179
00:06:59,471 --> 00:07:01,521
about having an affair with her roommate,

180
00:07:01,523 --> 00:07:03,139
I did not see that coming.

181
00:07:03,141 --> 00:07:06,275
Yeah, that just kind
of came to me recently.

182
00:07:06,277 --> 00:07:08,561
Everyone in the office is
talking about your story, Annie.

183
00:07:08,563 --> 00:07:10,613
We can't wait to see how it ends.

184
00:07:10,615 --> 00:07:15,401
Oh, um, actually, that is the end.

185
00:07:15,403 --> 00:07:17,820
I mean, it's based on me, and
that's what really happened.

186
00:07:17,822 --> 00:07:21,157
Which would make a perfect
ending to your diary;

187
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:24,127
perhaps my career in publishing.

188
00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:27,213
But this is not the
end to the best-selling

189
00:07:27,215 --> 00:07:30,616
erotic adventure novel that
hits book shelves in one month.

190
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:32,502
That feels soon.

191
00:07:32,504 --> 00:07:34,470
I know I am not the writer here,

192
00:07:34,472 --> 00:07:36,889
but can I pitch you something?

193
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:42,628
What if this is not a book about sex?

194
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,864
What if this is a book about love?

195
00:07:44,866 --> 00:07:46,015
You want me to cut out the sex?

196
00:07:46,017 --> 00:07:47,600
No.

197
00:07:47,602 --> 00:07:51,137
Maybe your ending just
needs to go a little deeper.

198
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:54,407
Maybe Annabelle realizes
her sexual adventures

199
00:07:54,409 --> 00:07:56,742
are merely masking her feelings for Leo.

200
00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:58,744
I mean, she did take a bullet for him.

201
00:07:58,746 --> 00:08:01,814
(awkward laugh) I think
you misread my work.

202
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:05,084
But Annabelle and Leo feel so right.

203
00:08:05,086 --> 00:08:06,318
They aren't.

204
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,288
Trust me, Annabelle has
been down that road before,

205
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,090
and it was not a happy ending.

206
00:08:12,676 --> 00:08:16,712
Annie, I know this is completely personal.

207
00:08:16,714 --> 00:08:19,098
But writing, you know, a lot like life,

208
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,633
is a search for truth.

209
00:08:20,635 --> 00:08:23,619
If there are feelings
this book has brought up

210
00:08:23,621 --> 00:08:25,188
that you're avoiding,

211
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,607
you're going to have to face them.

212
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,642
(clears throat)

213
00:08:29,644 --> 00:08:34,363
Well, um, thanks for
the suggestion, Amanda,

214
00:08:34,365 --> 00:08:36,732
but it's my story.

215
00:08:36,734 --> 00:08:37,984
Annie...

216
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:41,821
I suggest you figure out how it ends.

217
00:08:44,141 --> 00:08:47,410

219
00:09:00,384 --> 00:09:01,667
CAMPBELL: Navid, wait up.

220
00:09:01,669 --> 00:09:03,136
I need a favor.

221
00:09:03,138 --> 00:09:04,120
Oh, dude, are you serious?

222
00:09:04,122 --> 00:09:05,138
Yeah.

223
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:08,257
Final exam's bad enough, all right?

224
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:09,726
Right now I couldn't
help you pass an eye exam

225
00:09:09,728 --> 00:09:10,793
without getting an ulcer.

226
00:09:10,795 --> 00:09:14,130
Look, I know helping us out on
that test made you uncomfortable.

227
00:09:14,132 --> 00:09:15,982
I promise, that was a one-time thing.

228
00:09:15,984 --> 00:09:18,267
Okay, cool.

229
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:19,802
Uh, what's the favor?

230
00:09:19,804 --> 00:09:21,521
All right, six months ago I got engaged

231
00:09:21,523 --> 00:09:23,239
to a great girl named Sonja.

232
00:09:23,241 --> 00:09:24,907
Problem is, seven months ago,

233
00:09:24,909 --> 00:09:27,243
I broke up with a crazy ex named Elise.

234
00:09:27,245 --> 00:09:29,612
She keeps calling me
and wants to meet tonight

235
00:09:29,614 --> 00:09:31,781
to get closure on our relationship.

236
00:09:31,783 --> 00:09:33,616
Well, it sounds like
you moved on pretty fast.

237
00:09:33,618 --> 00:09:34,817
Really, Mom?

238
00:09:34,819 --> 00:09:35,818
(chuckling)

239
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,203
Oh, sorry, I get it.

240
00:09:37,205 --> 00:09:39,372
I've had my share of
complications with ex-girlfriends.

241
00:09:39,374 --> 00:09:41,157
Okay, then you understand
that I have to talk to the ex?

242
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,258
One please.

243
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:45,011
But Sonja has tickets to some event

244
00:09:45,013 --> 00:09:47,764
and I obviously don't want to blow her off.

245
00:09:47,766 --> 00:09:49,999
So, can you help me out?

246
00:09:50,001 --> 00:09:52,852
Okay, but you could be making a mistake

247
00:09:52,854 --> 00:09:54,720
sending me on a date with your fiancée.

248
00:09:54,722 --> 00:09:56,022
I am pretty charming.

249
00:09:56,024 --> 00:09:58,674
Actually, that's why I'm asking you.

250
00:09:58,676 --> 00:10:00,977
Sonja's always getting
hit on by douchebags.

251
00:10:00,979 --> 00:10:03,529
You're cool, she'll like
hanging out with you.

252
00:10:03,531 --> 00:10:05,514
Plus, you're one of the only guys I trust.

253
00:10:05,516 --> 00:10:06,866
Really?

254
00:10:06,868 --> 00:10:09,285
Yeah, you have integrity.

255
00:10:09,287 --> 00:10:10,787
I wasn't going to mention this yet,

256
00:10:10,789 --> 00:10:13,356
but after I graduate, Cronus
is going to need somebody

257
00:10:13,358 --> 00:10:14,457
to step up and lead.

258
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:16,259
I was thinking of recommending you.

259
00:10:16,261 --> 00:10:19,879
Wha... wow, seriously?

260
00:10:19,881 --> 00:10:21,581
Absolutely.

261
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:24,984
Brothers helping brothers
is what Cronus is all about.

262
00:10:24,986 --> 00:10:28,988
MICHAELA: * I can be your shining star *

263
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,857
♪ I will follow ♪

264
00:10:30,859 --> 00:10:32,374
♪ No matter where you are... ♪

265
00:10:32,376 --> 00:10:33,926
- Hey.
- * I will follow *

266
00:10:33,928 --> 00:10:35,761
Oh, um, Silver.

267
00:10:35,763 --> 00:10:37,880
I thought you were coming by later.

268
00:10:37,882 --> 00:10:41,017
Oh, yeah, well, I thought I'd
be out working on the truck.

269
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:42,735
Turns out, to get a business up and running

270
00:10:42,737 --> 00:10:43,769
(turns off music) you
should probably have an idea

271
00:10:43,771 --> 00:10:44,854
of what business to up and run.

272
00:10:44,856 --> 00:10:46,772
Wait, you guys still don't have an idea?

273
00:10:46,774 --> 00:10:48,825
No, and every idea we come up with

274
00:10:48,827 --> 00:10:50,326
somehow is worse than the last.

275
00:10:50,328 --> 00:10:52,278
In summary, I have

276
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,031
no career, no direction

277
00:10:55,033 --> 00:10:56,249
and really no prospects.

278
00:10:56,251 --> 00:10:58,334
What did you want to talk to me about?

279
00:10:58,336 --> 00:11:01,504
Oh, about people and their dreams,

280
00:11:01,506 --> 00:11:04,590
but... we totally shouldn't
talk about that right now.

281
00:11:04,592 --> 00:11:06,292
Um... hey, how about

282
00:11:06,294 --> 00:11:07,793
I help you brainstorm, huh?

283
00:11:07,795 --> 00:11:09,795
On the truck? Yeah.

284
00:11:09,797 --> 00:11:12,215
Yeah. Um, you know, maybe you guys

285
00:11:12,217 --> 00:11:14,250
need to stop thinking so businesslike

286
00:11:14,252 --> 00:11:17,753
and use the truck to
chase down your dreams.

287
00:11:17,755 --> 00:11:21,140
Like, ever since I've known you,
you wanted to be a filmmaker.

288
00:11:21,142 --> 00:11:23,042
Yeah, but... what does that have to do

289
00:11:23,044 --> 00:11:25,044
- with a former food truck?
- It could be

290
00:11:25,046 --> 00:11:27,346
your own movie studio on wheels.

291
00:11:27,348 --> 00:11:30,283
What, we'd, like... roll around town

292
00:11:30,285 --> 00:11:32,485
getting on-the-spot interviews?

293
00:11:32,527 --> 00:11:34,860
- Ade's really good on camera.
- She is.

294
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:36,662
(phone ringing) A documentary truck.

295
00:11:36,664 --> 00:11:39,282
I can't believe I didn't think of that.

296
00:11:39,284 --> 00:11:40,533
Yeah, see? Like I always say,

297
00:11:40,535 --> 00:11:41,867
every dream takes the first step.

298
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:43,753
- Like, uh, take Michaela, for instance...
- Hey.

299
00:11:43,755 --> 00:11:44,653
Sorry, it's Ade.

300
00:11:44,655 --> 00:11:46,255
Yes. New idea.

301
00:11:46,257 --> 00:11:47,290
I'm gonna tell her everything.

302
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:48,674
You're a genius. Thank you.

303
00:11:48,676 --> 00:11:51,260
Okay. I just talked to Dixon.

304
00:11:51,262 --> 00:11:53,346
What do you think about this?

305
00:11:53,348 --> 00:11:55,131
So, what if we...

306
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,353
Thanks for letting me crash here.

307
00:12:00,355 --> 00:12:01,687
The commute to the
restaurant was killing me.

308
00:12:01,689 --> 00:12:03,839
Hey, what are, uh, half sisters for?

309
00:12:03,841 --> 00:12:06,275
Besides, a roommate is
just what Liam and I need

310
00:12:06,277 --> 00:12:08,894
to break up the, um...

311
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:10,479
the monotony.

312
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:12,365
Go ahead.

313
00:12:14,284 --> 00:12:17,403
You brother-stealing little bitch.

314
00:12:17,405 --> 00:12:20,356
You pack Mark's things up, and
you send him to my house right now.

315
00:12:20,358 --> 00:12:22,041
Oh, I can't do that; I need him here.

316
00:12:22,043 --> 00:12:23,242
You need him?

317
00:12:23,244 --> 00:12:25,127
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm the one who found him.

318
00:12:25,129 --> 00:12:26,712
I'm the one who begged him to stay.

319
00:12:26,714 --> 00:12:29,215
I'm the one who invested a fortune
into his restaurant opening,

320
00:12:29,217 --> 00:12:31,217
so that I could develop a
relationship with the long-lost brother

321
00:12:31,219 --> 00:12:33,886
you didn't want anything to do with,
so please tell me why you need him.

322
00:12:33,888 --> 00:12:36,372
Look, I didn't know you were
gonna ask him to move in with you

323
00:12:36,374 --> 00:12:39,392
when I invited him to live here,
but... I need him as a buffer.

324
00:12:39,394 --> 00:12:41,260
As a...

325
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:42,979
- Hi.
- (laughs) Hey.

326
00:12:42,981 --> 00:12:45,064
A buffer from what?

327
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:47,433
(sighs) Hey.

328
00:12:47,435 --> 00:12:48,884
Door's fixed.

329
00:12:48,886 --> 00:12:50,603
I'm gonna head down to the Offshore

330
00:12:50,605 --> 00:12:53,072
and help out Mark a little
bit, but we'll be back.

331
00:12:53,074 --> 00:12:55,858
Your turn to do laundry. (both laugh)

332
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,077
- Bye, Liam.
- See ya.

333
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:04,400
Oh, I get it... you have the hots for Liam.

334
00:13:04,402 --> 00:13:06,252
Well, uh, look at him!

335
00:13:06,254 --> 00:13:08,120
What am I supposed to do?

336
00:13:08,122 --> 00:13:10,423
Jump his bones six ways to laundry day.

337
00:13:10,425 --> 00:13:12,425
I can't, okay? Liam and I are friends

338
00:13:12,427 --> 00:13:14,443
and roommates... we're
finally in a good place,

339
00:13:14,445 --> 00:13:15,878
and sex would totally ruin that.

340
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,748
And besides, it's always a huge
mistake to sleep with an ex.

341
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,766
Unless you don't want
him to be an ex anymore,

342
00:13:20,768 --> 00:13:22,435
in which case it's called
getting back together.

343
00:13:22,437 --> 00:13:24,387
Oh, no, that can't work. Unless it can.

344
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:26,539
- Not if it's not what I want.
- Unless it is.

345
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:29,809
Naomi, stop. I am under a huge
amount of pressure right now

346
00:13:29,811 --> 00:13:32,561
to finish this project,
and all I want is to stop

347
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:34,330
being distracted by Liam's torso!

348
00:13:34,332 --> 00:13:38,651
Mark moving in may not
be the best plan, but...

349
00:13:38,653 --> 00:13:40,319
unless Liam gets really fat

350
00:13:40,321 --> 00:13:41,770
or my mom comes into town,

351
00:13:41,772 --> 00:13:43,039
it's the only one I've got.

352
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:45,624
So find a different way to
get to know your new brother.

353
00:13:45,626 --> 00:13:47,376
Mark's staying here.

354
00:13:51,754 --> 00:13:54,083
<i>MARK: We squeezed in two
extra tables... not bad.</i>

355
00:13:54,085 --> 00:13:56,635
- Thanks for your help.
- Oh. Thank Annie.

356
00:13:56,637 --> 00:13:58,587
She gave me a lecture

357
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:00,497
about not sitting around
waiting for life to happen.

358
00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:03,426
I usually tune her out, but...

359
00:14:03,428 --> 00:14:05,678
something she said just stuck in my head.

360
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,963
Hey, what's going on with
these empty beer vats?

361
00:14:07,965 --> 00:14:10,483
I was gonna try to get a
brew going before the opening.

362
00:14:10,485 --> 00:14:11,851
But I'm not gonna have time.

363
00:14:11,853 --> 00:14:13,319
Oh, yeah? Hmm.

364
00:14:13,321 --> 00:14:15,855
I was actually playing
around brewing my own beer

365
00:14:15,857 --> 00:14:17,356
before the bar burned down. Brewed about

366
00:14:17,358 --> 00:14:19,141
a keg of it... just needs to be bottled.

367
00:14:19,143 --> 00:14:21,477
Why don't you try out a
small batch at the opening?

368
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:23,179
People like it, the vats are yours.

369
00:14:23,181 --> 00:14:25,030
Seriously?

370
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:29,418
Yeah, I... I've got that
small space downstairs.

371
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,705
I... I... I guess if it
works out, I could actually...

372
00:14:32,707 --> 00:14:34,373
open my own micro-brewery.

373
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,791
Make it happen, bro.

374
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:38,260
All right, yeah. Thanks, that'd be great.

375
00:14:40,097 --> 00:14:43,215
Hey. That half brother
of yours, he's a keeper.

376
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:44,717
Um...

377
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,522
Looks like you and Liam are bonding

378
00:14:49,524 --> 00:14:51,507
like you're related and have
known each other forever.

379
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:52,808
Just getting some help setting up.

380
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,310
It's hard to believe, but I think

381
00:14:54,312 --> 00:14:56,345
we might actually be ready for
this opening tomorrow night.

382
00:14:56,347 --> 00:14:59,148
Good. Because tomorrow
you and I are spending

383
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,816
the entire day together,

384
00:15:00,818 --> 00:15:03,953
- outside the restaurant.
- I don't know, there's still a ton of details.

385
00:15:03,955 --> 00:15:05,204
No, there's not.

386
00:15:05,206 --> 00:15:06,539
I handled everything.

387
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:07,823
I'm really excited about us

388
00:15:07,825 --> 00:15:09,125
opening this restaurant together, but...

389
00:15:09,127 --> 00:15:11,660
I want us to be more than
just business partners,

390
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:14,663
- I want it to really feel like we're family.
- Is this because

391
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:16,715
I called Liam "bro"?
That's just a guy thing,

392
00:15:16,717 --> 00:15:18,334
like slapping each other on the butt.

393
00:15:18,336 --> 00:15:19,485
Doesn't mean anything.

394
00:15:19,487 --> 00:15:21,587
Getting to know you would...

395
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:23,172
mean something to me.

396
00:15:23,174 --> 00:15:26,008
Okay. After everything you've done for me,

397
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,676
I can do this for you.

398
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:29,678
Relaxing before the opening can't hurt.

399
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,547
Yay! Okay, leave everything up to me.

400
00:15:31,549 --> 00:15:32,882
Tomorrow we make memories.

401
00:15:32,884 --> 00:15:34,433
(laughs)

402
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:39,888
<i>NAVID: I hear this
hotel has a great new bar</i>

403
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,491
and since Campbell is
paying for this night,

404
00:15:42,493 --> 00:15:45,578
I say we order a few very expensive drinks.

405
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,396
Yeah, we're gonna need
them after "An Evening

406
00:15:47,398 --> 00:15:49,698
of Avant-Garde Russian Theater."

407
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,084
- I'm sorry it was so boring.
- What?!

408
00:15:52,086 --> 00:15:53,836
What are you talking about?

409
00:15:53,838 --> 00:15:55,921
I loved their fresh take on despair.

410
00:15:55,923 --> 00:15:58,740
(laughs) Yeah, I'm getting
front-row seats tomorrow night.

411
00:15:58,742 --> 00:16:01,427
Well... assuming there is a tomorrow.

412
00:16:01,429 --> 00:16:05,130
(laughs) You know, Campbell said
that you were somebody I should meet,

413
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,882
and I'm really glad I did.

414
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:10,419
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I love all the Cronus guys...

415
00:16:10,421 --> 00:16:13,022
At first I wasn't sure I fit
in, but I'm glad I joined.

416
00:16:13,024 --> 00:16:15,224
And now that I know what a
cool fiancée Campbell has,

417
00:16:15,226 --> 00:16:16,775
you know, I'm starting to like him more.

418
00:16:16,777 --> 00:16:18,694
Good. Well, why don't I get those drinks.

419
00:16:18,696 --> 00:16:21,096
And you want to see if
you can get us a table?

420
00:16:21,098 --> 00:16:23,649
Yeah, I'll do that. Okay.

421
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,294
Hey.

422
00:16:49,936 --> 00:16:54,022
MARK: Amusement park lines...
not the relaxing day I thought.

423
00:16:54,024 --> 00:16:56,007
You sure you don't want to
go sit in traffic instead?

424
00:16:56,009 --> 00:16:57,359
Come on, this is something we totally

425
00:16:57,361 --> 00:16:58,810
would've done if we grew up together.

426
00:16:58,812 --> 00:17:01,530
I thought it'd be a fun way
to get to know each other.

427
00:17:03,783 --> 00:17:05,867
Tell me something about yourself.

428
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:08,987
Okay, let's see, uh, I
hate waiting in lines,

429
00:17:08,989 --> 00:17:11,990
I hate talking about
myself, I love puppies.

430
00:17:11,992 --> 00:17:14,659
Oh. (laughs)

431
00:17:14,661 --> 00:17:16,694
NAOMI: Oh, look... they have jumper passes.

432
00:17:16,696 --> 00:17:18,964
You pay a little extra and you go
straight to the front... no waiting.

433
00:17:18,966 --> 00:17:21,833
What kind of jerks pay to skip
the line? Total one-percenter move.

434
00:17:21,835 --> 00:17:25,420
(laughs): You're right. That's so not me.

435
00:17:25,422 --> 00:17:28,590
I would never throw money at a problem.

436
00:17:28,592 --> 00:17:30,592
Is that Marc Jacobs? I love your sweater.

437
00:17:30,594 --> 00:17:33,345
- Uh, actually it's Tom...
- Ford?

438
00:17:33,347 --> 00:17:34,396
Tom Ford?

439
00:17:34,398 --> 00:17:36,731
There you go... we have
something in common.

440
00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:38,149
Good fashion sense.

441
00:17:38,151 --> 00:17:39,901
It's not Tom Ford. Tom Hegarty.

442
00:17:39,903 --> 00:17:41,770
He had a garage sale last weekend.

443
00:17:41,772 --> 00:17:43,488
I got this sweater and a
pretty sweet bowling ball.

444
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:45,106
Designer clothes are such a waste of money.

445
00:17:45,108 --> 00:17:48,910
(groans) I couldn't agree more.

446
00:17:54,417 --> 00:17:55,900
- Yo.
- Oh, hey.

447
00:17:55,902 --> 00:17:58,753
Hey, Sonja said she had a
great time with you last night.

448
00:17:58,755 --> 00:18:00,088
Thanks for helping me out.

449
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,374
Yeah, she was a... she's a nice girl.

450
00:18:02,376 --> 00:18:04,793
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh... so, uh,

451
00:18:04,795 --> 00:18:06,511
how did things go with your ex?

452
00:18:06,513 --> 00:18:07,629
Great. We talked.

453
00:18:07,631 --> 00:18:09,414
She got the closure she needed.

454
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:10,882
I even got home early.

455
00:18:10,884 --> 00:18:12,884
- Oh, really?
- Yep.

456
00:18:12,886 --> 00:18:15,554
So you two just... talked?

457
00:18:15,556 --> 00:18:17,022
Yeah. Yeah.

458
00:18:17,024 --> 00:18:18,723
Hey, listen, Sonja said

459
00:18:18,725 --> 00:18:20,859
you're going to your friend's
restaurant opening tonight?

460
00:18:20,861 --> 00:18:24,145
- Mm-hmm.
- She really wants us to go, too, but I'm busy,

461
00:18:24,147 --> 00:18:25,930
so I can't make it, and I was wondering

462
00:18:25,932 --> 00:18:27,699
if maybe you could keep an eye on her,

463
00:18:27,701 --> 00:18:29,901
- since you're gonna be there anyway?
- Where are you gonna be?

464
00:18:29,903 --> 00:18:33,104
In my room... I have a ton
of homework to catch up on.

465
00:18:33,106 --> 00:18:36,124
Even the head of Cronus has to take
a break from all the socializing

466
00:18:36,126 --> 00:18:38,126
and crack a book every once in a while.

467
00:18:38,128 --> 00:18:40,078
Pretty soon you'll know
exactly what I'm talking about,

468
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,296
Mr. Future Head of Cronus.

469
00:18:41,298 --> 00:18:43,465
- Eh.
- (chuckles) Thanks, man.

470
00:18:43,467 --> 00:18:44,583
I owe you, all right?

471
00:18:44,585 --> 00:18:46,501
Yeah, okay.

472
00:18:48,087 --> 00:18:49,721
(sighs)

473
00:18:50,556 --> 00:18:51,956
ADRIANNA: Okay.

474
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,142
It's time to practice my interviewer face.

475
00:18:54,144 --> 00:18:57,762
Does this lipstick say, "Ooh, interesting,"

476
00:18:57,764 --> 00:19:00,265
or... "I share your pain."

477
00:19:00,267 --> 00:19:02,601
It kind of just looks
like you ate a Popsicle.

478
00:19:02,603 --> 00:19:04,019
So, what is

479
00:19:04,021 --> 00:19:05,854
this whole documentary thing about again?

480
00:19:05,856 --> 00:19:07,238
Big stories of everyday people.

481
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,324
We drive around, we get people to talk

482
00:19:09,326 --> 00:19:10,975
about their hopes and their dreams,

483
00:19:10,977 --> 00:19:12,744
and then we find something amazing.

484
00:19:12,746 --> 00:19:14,663
This was your brother's genius idea.

485
00:19:14,665 --> 00:19:16,414
Well, thanks for letting me tag along.

486
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,199
I needed to get out of the house,

487
00:19:18,201 --> 00:19:20,318
and... maybe hearing about
other people's stories

488
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,537
will help me get over my writer's block.

489
00:19:22,539 --> 00:19:25,090
Why don't you just write about
your steamy lust for Liam?

490
00:19:25,092 --> 00:19:26,174
Hello.

491
00:19:26,176 --> 00:19:31,046
- Wait, who told you about that?
- Naomi said you stole Mark and used him

492
00:19:31,048 --> 00:19:32,430
as a sex buffer.

493
00:19:32,432 --> 00:19:33,998
Half brother as a chaperone.

494
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,519
<i>- That's a desperate move.
- You must want Liam real bad.</i>

495
00:19:37,521 --> 00:19:38,687
No, I don't.

496
00:19:38,689 --> 00:19:40,221
Okay, I do a little bit.

497
00:19:40,223 --> 00:19:42,941
But not really. I think.

498
00:19:42,943 --> 00:19:47,228
- I don't know.
- SILVER: Well, I know that lust is not confusing.

499
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,614
Real feelings are confusing.

500
00:19:49,616 --> 00:19:52,317
This is my interviewer face

501
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:54,569
for, "You're not telling
us the whole story""

502
00:19:54,571 --> 00:19:56,237
Okay, fine, fine.

503
00:19:56,239 --> 00:19:58,873
I keep thinking about sex with Liam.

504
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,942
Go on.

505
00:20:02,461 --> 00:20:04,045
No! Look,

506
00:20:04,047 --> 00:20:07,048
I was sure that by getting
through this thing I'm writing

507
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:08,366
it would stop,

508
00:20:08,368 --> 00:20:10,168
but it hasn't. I know I don't want

509
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,537
a relationship with Liam,
so why do I keep thinking

510
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:13,972
about having sex with him?

511
00:20:13,974 --> 00:20:16,374
Because sex with Liam
would ruin your friendship

512
00:20:16,376 --> 00:20:18,226
and your living situation,

513
00:20:18,228 --> 00:20:21,379
therefore a really great way
to run away from your feelings.

514
00:20:21,381 --> 00:20:25,066
Oh, my God, that is exactly
what Amanda said about Annabelle.

515
00:20:25,068 --> 00:20:27,602
Okay, I don't know who those girls are,

516
00:20:27,604 --> 00:20:30,221
but, um, even if you did
have feelings for Liam,

517
00:20:30,223 --> 00:20:31,840
there'd be nothing wrong with that.

518
00:20:31,842 --> 00:20:33,158
Yes, there would.

519
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,527
Liam and I have tried to
make it work a hundred times.

520
00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:37,862
If it were meant to be, it
would have happened by now.

521
00:20:37,864 --> 00:20:40,915
(scoffs) What, like my documentary career?

522
00:20:40,917 --> 00:20:42,400
I've started it a hundred times, too,

523
00:20:42,402 --> 00:20:44,569
but it doesn't mean it's
not gonna work out this time.

524
00:20:44,571 --> 00:20:46,921
Exactly. As pathetic and as hopeless

525
00:20:46,923 --> 00:20:48,573
as this truck idea is,

526
00:20:48,575 --> 00:20:50,341
it can work if we try.

527
00:20:50,343 --> 00:20:52,761
Watch.

528
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:56,914
What are you doing?

529
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:59,517
Cosmetic counters do this all the time.

530
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,386
People stop for something
that they want, and then

531
00:21:01,388 --> 00:21:02,804
we get what we want in return.

532
00:21:02,806 --> 00:21:07,275
It proves that dumb ideas
can work if you keep trying.

- Hey.

536
00:21:18,104 --> 00:21:20,772
I thought I heard you upstairs on the mic.

537
00:21:20,774 --> 00:21:22,907
You deejaying the opening?

538
00:21:22,909 --> 00:21:26,161
No, no, um, I'm actually doing a little...

539
00:21:26,163 --> 00:21:28,213
showcase for Michaela, so I was upstairs

540
00:21:28,215 --> 00:21:29,614
setting up some equipment.

541
00:21:29,616 --> 00:21:31,966
Hey, dude, do you have an extension cord?

542
00:21:31,968 --> 00:21:35,386
Uh... yeah, yeah, let me get you one.

543
00:21:35,388 --> 00:21:36,554
Thanks.

544
00:21:36,556 --> 00:21:37,839
(clears throat)

545
00:21:37,841 --> 00:21:39,791
Wait, wait, you mean surrogate Michaela?

546
00:21:39,793 --> 00:21:42,510
- Mm-hmm.
- I didn't know she wanted to be a singer.

547
00:21:42,512 --> 00:21:45,146
Neither did she, until I
discovered her raw talent.

548
00:21:45,148 --> 00:21:46,481
- You did? 
- Mm-hmm.

549
00:21:46,483 --> 00:21:48,183
What's Silver think about that?

550
00:21:48,185 --> 00:21:53,321
(sighs) Why does everybody
keep asking me about that?

551
00:21:53,323 --> 00:21:55,607
Because she wasn't in a good place, okay?

552
00:21:55,609 --> 00:21:58,193
So, now she's out having
a great day, thanks to me,

553
00:21:58,195 --> 00:21:59,828
so when she gets to the showcase,

554
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:02,781
Michaela will get on
stage and seal the deal.

555
00:22:02,783 --> 00:22:04,032
Well,

556
00:22:04,034 --> 00:22:06,417
if you really want to make Silver's day,

557
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:10,154
you should buy her a
beer made by yours truly.

558
00:22:10,156 --> 00:22:12,924
Handcrafted using only
the finest ingredients.

559
00:22:12,926 --> 00:22:15,493
Okay, well, uh, you
got the commercial down.

560
00:22:15,495 --> 00:22:18,179
I hope this lives up to the hype.

561
00:22:18,181 --> 00:22:19,347
Yeah, man, me, too.

562
00:22:19,349 --> 00:22:20,381
I got to find something that I love

563
00:22:20,383 --> 00:22:23,601
and just make it happen, you know?

564
00:22:24,603 --> 00:22:26,054
Damn, dude, is that the board

565
00:22:26,056 --> 00:22:27,338
that you showed me last week?

566
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:30,191
- Yeah.
- Yo, it is sick.

567
00:22:30,193 --> 00:22:31,810
We got to take it out for a test run, man.

568
00:22:31,812 --> 00:22:33,895
Yeah, yeah. Another time, though.

569
00:22:33,897 --> 00:22:36,030
Today, we drink.

570
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:39,400
The Liam Court Brewing Company presents...

571
00:22:39,402 --> 00:22:40,702
Court of Appeal.

572
00:22:40,704 --> 00:22:41,870
What?

573
00:22:41,872 --> 00:22:43,071
(laughs) Get it?

574
00:22:43,073 --> 00:22:44,405
- 'Cause it's appealing?
- I get it, I get it.

575
00:22:44,407 --> 00:22:46,157
Go on, man, try it. You're gonna love it.

576
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,877
(Liam beats drumroll on table)

577
00:22:48,879 --> 00:22:50,295
Okay.

578
00:22:50,297 --> 00:22:52,163
Huh?

579
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:00,221
Um... I... I think there's
something wrong with it.

580
00:23:00,223 --> 00:23:02,924
What? No. I followed the recipe exactly.

581
00:23:02,926 --> 00:23:04,208
You just don't know how to drink beer.

582
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,560
You don't sip it like a latte.

583
00:23:05,562 --> 00:23:06,711
Uh, I don't think anybody's

584
00:23:06,713 --> 00:23:08,646
supposed to sip that, dude. Try it.

585
00:23:13,569 --> 00:23:15,436
Maybe it just needs to ferment more.

586
00:23:15,438 --> 00:23:17,155
Look, I'm... I'm not trying to be harsh,

587
00:23:17,157 --> 00:23:18,222
uh, but... 

588
00:23:18,224 --> 00:23:20,859
Court of Appeal deserves the death penalty.

Plus, I got to hear about your
junior high obsession with Hanson.

Oh, come on, you have to admit
that song was very catchy.

This was stupid idea.

that I don't like you...

Why should you?

602
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,020
Just because when I found out you existed,

You know what? You're right.

606

We need to get back because we have

607
00:23:55,445 --> 00:23:56,594
to open the restaurant tonight.

608
00:23:56,596 --> 00:23:57,979
Uh, if traffic's light, we'll be fine.

When you invite a few friends
and family to a restaurant

612
00:24:03,987 --> 00:24:06,070
to work out the kinks before you go wide.

613
00:24:06,072 --> 00:24:07,622
You know, what we're doing tonight.

614

- A hundred.
- A hundred?!

Hey. Hey.

631
00:24:52,469 --> 00:24:53,835
I got your message. I opened the bar,

632
00:24:53,837 --> 00:24:55,354
but they're starting to get hungry.

633
00:24:55,356 --> 00:24:57,672
We don't have enough waitstaff
or food for this crowd.

634

This is a disaster.

635

I'm said I'm sorry.

Are you gonna stop complaining long enough

637
00:25:01,178 --> 00:25:02,677
for us to figure out what we're gonna do?

638
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:05,230
We can't feed a hundred people
from the full menu, so...

we go family style.

640
00:25:06,233 --> 00:25:07,616
Everyone on the floor gets a soup,

641
00:25:07,618 --> 00:25:08,683
an entree and a dessert.

642
00:25:08,685 --> 00:25:09,901
Same food for every person.

You're gonna have
nightmares about this night

Uh, I'm not sure it's documentary material.

when we met, but he wasn't ready.

668

So, he went off and joined the Navy,

669
00:25:58,118 --> 00:26:02,838
and I swore I'd never get
hurt like that again, so...

670
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,706
I did everything I could
to convince myself he wasn't

Finally, we both wanted the same thing.

00:27:22,002 --> 00:27:24,369
have you guys, set a date?

706
00:27:24,371 --> 00:27:25,787
No, Campbell wants to work for the company

707
00:27:25,789 --> 00:27:28,089
for at least a year before
we really settle down.

708
00:27:28,091 --> 00:27:29,657
Oh. What company?

709
00:27:29,659 --> 00:27:30,825
He didn't tell you?

710
00:27:30,827 --> 00:27:32,660
Well, my father runs one of the biggest

711
00:27:32,662 --> 00:27:34,296
investment banking firms in the state,

712
00:27:34,298 --> 00:27:35,997
and he's putting Campbell
on the executive track

713
00:27:35,999 --> 00:27:37,098
right after graduation.

714
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,167
Wow, it takes guys years to get that far.

715
00:27:39,169 --> 00:27:41,052
Yeah, well... I'm excited for him,

716
00:27:41,054 --> 00:27:42,637
but he's gonna be working really hard.

717
00:27:42,639 --> 00:27:44,839
Yeah, I can imagine
Campbell's gonna be having

718
00:27:44,841 --> 00:27:46,808
a lot of, uh, late nights.

719
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:48,009
Well, that's okay.

720
00:27:48,011 --> 00:27:49,511
It's important to build your career.

721
00:27:49,513 --> 00:27:50,946
You know, he'd probably put in

722
00:27:50,948 --> 00:27:52,264
a good word for you at the company.

723
00:27:52,266 --> 00:27:54,950
He loves going that extra
mile for his Cronus brothers.

724
00:27:54,952 --> 00:27:56,701
It's practically his mantra:

725
00:27:56,703 --> 00:27:58,537
brothers helping brothers.

726
00:27:58,539 --> 00:28:00,572
You know what? You're right.

727
00:28:00,574 --> 00:28:02,874
Campbell is working so
hard, he's probably ready

728
00:28:02,876 --> 00:28:04,409
for a little study break.

729
00:28:04,411 --> 00:28:06,194
What do you say we go
surprise him right now

730
00:28:06,196 --> 00:28:08,363
with some of these, uh, delicious chips?

731
00:28:08,365 --> 00:28:09,531
Okay.

732
00:28:09,533 --> 00:28:10,799
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

733
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,419
Everything will be out in just a second.

734
00:28:14,421 --> 00:28:15,554
(sighs)

735
00:28:15,556 --> 00:28:17,205
Dixon, thank God.

736
00:28:17,207 --> 00:28:18,390
The kitchen is backed up,

737
00:28:18,392 --> 00:28:19,424
the crowd is going crazy.

738
00:28:19,426 --> 00:28:22,377
I need you to get Michaela
on stage right now to sing.

739
00:28:22,379 --> 00:28:24,563
I... I can't, I haven't talked to Silver yet.

740
00:28:24,565 --> 00:28:26,097
If you don't get her on stage,

741
00:28:26,099 --> 00:28:27,682
these people are going to kill someone,

742
00:28:27,684 --> 00:28:29,267
and that someone is gonna be you

743
00:28:29,269 --> 00:28:30,936
because I will get on the mic
and tell them it's all your fault.

744
00:28:30,938 --> 00:28:32,904
Okay, okay, fine, fine, you got it.

745
00:28:32,906 --> 00:28:35,574
Thank you. When you're done,
I need you take out the trash.

746
00:28:35,576 --> 00:28:36,575
Hell, no.

747
00:28:36,577 --> 00:28:37,909
- Okay, o... okay...
- Hello?

748
00:28:37,911 --> 00:28:39,227
I meant, "Hell, yes."

749
00:28:39,229 --> 00:28:40,278
Thank you.

750
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,830
She's playing.

751
00:28:41,832 --> 00:28:43,081
It's okay.

752
00:28:45,117 --> 00:28:47,118
I'm gonna go look for Liam.

753
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,453
This place looks different.

754
00:28:48,455 --> 00:28:50,455
It's amazing.

755
00:28:50,457 --> 00:28:52,090
SILVER: I can't believe after a whole day

756
00:28:52,092 --> 00:28:53,542
we only got one interview.

757
00:28:53,544 --> 00:28:55,043
It was a good one, but still...

758
00:28:55,045 --> 00:28:56,461
Hey, it was your first time out.

759
00:28:56,463 --> 00:28:57,679
Besides,

760
00:28:57,681 --> 00:29:00,098
your one interview made
quite the impact on Annie.

761
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,217
Yeah... yeah, you're right.

762
00:29:02,219 --> 00:29:04,686
I should probably thank
Dixon for getting me started.

763
00:29:04,688 --> 00:29:06,771
Like he said, every dream

764
00:29:06,773 --> 00:29:09,107
begins with a first step. (chuckles)

765
00:29:09,109 --> 00:29:11,393
MICHAELA: Hey, everybody.

766
00:29:11,395 --> 00:29:14,396
Is that Michaela on stage?

767
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:16,281
So, this is kind of a dream of mine

768
00:29:16,283 --> 00:29:18,266
to get this chance, so...

769
00:29:18,268 --> 00:29:20,368
well, thanks for giving me a shot.

He just left with his stinky beer.

I'm so glad you're here.

782
00:30:00,327 --> 00:30:01,526

00:30:01,528 --> 00:30:02,827

keep the front of the house clean.

789
00:30:10,253 --> 00:30:11,986

Hey.

797
00:30:37,781 --> 00:30:39,314
This was amazing.

798
00:30:39,316 --> 00:30:40,515
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

799
00:30:40,517 --> 00:30:42,567
Look, it means so much
to me that you're cool

800
00:30:42,569 --> 00:30:43,902
with me doing this with Dixon.

801
00:30:43,904 --> 00:30:46,571
He thinks it's a really good
first step before we start

802
00:30:46,573 --> 00:30:47,689
getting serious in the studio.

803
00:30:47,691 --> 00:30:49,190
Wait.

804
00:30:49,192 --> 00:30:51,242
- You're recording with Dixon?
- Yeah.

805
00:30:51,244 --> 00:30:53,244
I mean, he said he was gonna talk to you

806
00:30:53,246 --> 00:30:55,413
and make sure you were cool
with me pursuing my dream.

807
00:30:55,415 --> 00:30:56,414
Okay.

808
00:30:56,416 --> 00:30:58,633
Oh, God, please tell me he spoke to you.

809
00:30:58,635 --> 00:31:00,685
No.

810
00:31:01,587 --> 00:31:03,722
Just give me one second.

811
00:31:03,724 --> 00:31:05,373
Yeah.

812
00:31:06,475 --> 00:31:07,726
Hey, Silver.

813
00:31:07,728 --> 00:31:09,060
Uh, how was your big day?

814
00:31:09,062 --> 00:31:10,795
Not as good as yours.

815
00:31:11,714 --> 00:31:12,981
I spent all day on a truck

816
00:31:12,983 --> 00:31:14,065
and I got one interview.

817
00:31:14,067 --> 00:31:17,318
You just found your new recording star.

818
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,154
Oh, uh, look, I... I can explain.

819
00:31:19,156 --> 00:31:20,939
No, you don't have to, 'cause I get it.

820
00:31:20,941 --> 00:31:22,741
Michaela's my surrogate, but you decided

821
00:31:22,743 --> 00:31:24,492
to talk her into a singing career,

822
00:31:24,494 --> 00:31:26,277
because, I don't know, what could be better

823
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:28,780
for my unborn child than
long nights on a tour bus

824
00:31:28,782 --> 00:31:30,248
going from club to club?

825
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,666
Silver, I wouldn't do that.

826
00:31:31,668 --> 00:31:33,084
Yes, you would, Dixon.

827
00:31:33,086 --> 00:31:34,703
Because you don't care
about what's important to me

828
00:31:34,705 --> 00:31:37,539
or anyone else, you only care
about what's important to you.

829
00:31:37,541 --> 00:31:39,741
The pep talk?

830
00:31:39,743 --> 00:31:41,292
About following my dreams?

831
00:31:41,294 --> 00:31:43,428
It makes sense now.

832
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,430
You weren't talking about my dreams,

833
00:31:45,432 --> 00:31:48,299
you were just talking about yours.

834
00:31:50,436 --> 00:31:53,722
(sighs)

835
00:31:57,917 --> 00:31:59,734
Last of the entrees coming up.

836
00:31:59,736 --> 00:32:00,752
I need my avocados now.

837
00:32:00,754 --> 00:32:01,670
Okay.

838
00:32:01,672 --> 00:32:02,955
I said now, not next Thursday.

839
00:32:02,957 --> 00:32:04,506
You want them faster,
I can throw them at you.

840
00:32:04,508 --> 00:32:06,208
Hey, the toilet's backed
up in the men's room.

841
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,176
NAOMI AND MARK: Handle it!

842
00:32:07,178 --> 00:32:09,077
Me? Come on.

843
00:32:09,963 --> 00:32:12,598
(electronic tones sound)

844
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,967
Dixon, how could you
just forget to tell her?

845
00:32:14,969 --> 00:32:16,135
I... I didn't forget.

846
00:32:16,137 --> 00:32:18,220
I was just waiting foe perfect time, okay?

847
00:32:18,222 --> 00:32:19,304
I screwed up, I know.

848
00:32:19,306 --> 00:32:21,356
Silver must be so pissed.

849
00:32:21,358 --> 00:32:23,358
This baby thing is her dream.

850
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,394
I know.

851
00:32:25,396 --> 00:32:27,446
And that's why I'm gonna
fix this. One second.

852
00:32:27,448 --> 00:32:28,530
Ade.

853
00:32:28,532 --> 00:32:29,898
Hey, um...

854
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,983
Hey.

855
00:32:30,985 --> 00:32:32,100
Look, Silver's not picking up

856
00:32:32,102 --> 00:32:33,202
my phone calls right now,

857
00:32:33,204 --> 00:32:35,220
and I really need to get a message to her,

858
00:32:35,222 --> 00:32:37,556
so, uh... is the camera
equipment still here?

859
00:32:37,558 --> 00:32:39,791
Yeah, it's in the truck parked out front.

860
00:32:39,793 --> 00:32:42,110
Oh, perfect. Thank you.

861
00:32:43,446 --> 00:32:44,746
Hey, hey, that's not hot fudge

862
00:32:44,748 --> 00:32:46,548
you're slapping on there, it's argan oil.

863
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,549
It's extremely rare.

864
00:32:47,551 --> 00:32:48,584
You drizzle it.

865
00:32:48,586 --> 00:32:50,252
Okay, you know what, Mark?

866
00:32:50,254 --> 00:32:52,221
I've been busting my ass for you all night.

867
00:32:52,223 --> 00:32:53,805
How about a "please" and "thank you"?

868
00:32:53,807 --> 00:32:54,890
Please get out of my way.

869
00:32:54,892 --> 00:32:56,475
Thank you.

870
00:32:59,062 --> 00:33:00,012
What are you doing?

871
00:33:00,014 --> 00:33:01,563
I'm sitting down.

872
00:33:01,565 --> 00:33:03,682
I'm tired. I haven't eaten all night.

873
00:33:03,684 --> 00:33:05,467
I feel like I'm gonna faint.

874
00:33:05,469 --> 00:33:09,938
You know what? You can serve
your stupid desserts yourself.

875
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:13,192
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna
have a business, thanks to you.

876
00:33:13,194 --> 00:33:15,160
And I'm not the one with the
mansion and the designer clothes

877
00:33:15,162 --> 00:33:16,311
and the line-jumper pass.

878
00:33:16,313 --> 00:33:17,829
This actually meant something to me.

879
00:33:17,831 --> 00:33:19,164
I can't believe I used to daydream

880
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:20,782
about what my brother would be like...

881
00:33:20,784 --> 00:33:22,451
how he'd always be there for me

882
00:33:22,453 --> 00:33:24,002
and how he'd always have my back.

883
00:33:24,004 --> 00:33:25,871
And then voilà, I meet
him and... (chuckles)

884
00:33:25,873 --> 00:33:28,207
he's a total douche.
I c... I can't breathe.

885
00:33:28,991 --> 00:33:32,494
(gasping): I can't breathe.

886
00:33:32,496 --> 00:33:35,430
M... my throat. (coughing)

887
00:33:35,432 --> 00:33:36,515
My throat, Mark.

888
00:33:36,517 --> 00:33:37,549
(gasping) Hold still.

889
00:33:37,551 --> 00:33:38,500
What are you doing?

890
00:33:38,502 --> 00:33:41,270
Ow! (groaning)

891
00:33:41,272 --> 00:33:43,689
Just breathe.

892
00:33:43,691 --> 00:33:46,892
(groans, panting)

893
00:33:52,348 --> 00:33:53,865
What just happened?

894
00:33:53,867 --> 00:33:55,517
I might've just saved your life.

895
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:05,377
Oh. (grunts)

896
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:07,162
(bottles clinking) Whoa.

897
00:34:07,164 --> 00:34:09,298
Clean up on aisle nine!

898
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,049
Oh, my God.

899
00:34:11,051 --> 00:34:13,085
I was trying to make my beer taste better.

900
00:34:13,087 --> 00:34:15,470
Marshmallow whip almost did the trick.

901
00:34:15,472 --> 00:34:16,421
Are you drunk?

902
00:34:16,423 --> 00:34:19,391
What? No. (scoffs)

903
00:34:19,393 --> 00:34:21,727
It's not like I drank it... all.

904
00:34:22,712 --> 00:34:24,896
Spilled a bunch... most
of it... on my clothes.

905
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:27,766
But, hey, lucky for you, it's
my turn to do the laundry.

906
00:34:27,768 --> 00:34:28,734
(chuckles)

907
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,485
Hey, come here.

908
00:34:30,487 --> 00:34:33,071
Oh, okay. (sighs)

909
00:34:33,073 --> 00:34:35,941
You smell like nice soap.

910
00:34:35,943 --> 00:34:37,109
(chuckles)

911
00:34:37,111 --> 00:34:40,061
Hey. Hey.

912
00:34:40,063 --> 00:34:42,063
You were right.

913
00:34:42,065 --> 00:34:46,001
When am I gonna figure out what I want?

914
00:34:49,622 --> 00:34:52,240
O... okay. Okay, uh...

915
00:34:52,242 --> 00:34:56,178
if we're about to do what
I think we both want to do...

916
00:34:57,013 --> 00:34:59,431
then we have to finally get it right.

917
00:34:59,433 --> 00:35:02,917
I know we've tried this,
like, a hundred times, but...

918
00:35:02,919 --> 00:35:05,304
if we're both ready
and want the same thing,

919
00:35:05,306 --> 00:35:09,107
then I want this to be our 101.

920
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:12,611
(sighs) I think I still love you, Liam.

921
00:35:13,446 --> 00:35:15,930
(snoring)

922
00:35:17,984 --> 00:35:19,351
Liam?

923
00:35:19,353 --> 00:35:21,770
(snoring)

924
00:35:22,622 --> 00:35:24,790
(sighs)

925
00:35:29,478 --> 00:35:32,480
Sorry I wasn't able to help
you finish the desserts.

926
00:35:32,482 --> 00:35:33,948
It's fine.

927
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:35,866
At least no one else
had an allergic reaction.

928
00:35:35,868 --> 00:35:38,602
(chuckles) The paramedics gave
me some more antihistamines.

929
00:35:38,604 --> 00:35:41,455
- Who's allergic to argan oil anyway?
- You.

930
00:35:41,457 --> 00:35:45,209
And me. Which is why I always
have epinephrine nearby.

931
00:35:46,795 --> 00:35:49,780
Well, I guess sharing the
same weird allergy means we...

932
00:35:49,782 --> 00:35:52,083
have at least one thing
in common. (chuckles)

933
00:35:52,085 --> 00:35:54,502
Might even make us family adjacent.

934
00:35:55,954 --> 00:35:58,222
You know how you said you thought about me?

935
00:35:58,224 --> 00:36:00,257
How you wondered who I was?

936
00:36:00,259 --> 00:36:03,260
The truth is... I thought about you, too.

937
00:36:04,062 --> 00:36:05,980
- You did?
- Yeah.

938
00:36:05,982 --> 00:36:08,599
My parents told me I was
adopted pretty early on.

939
00:36:08,601 --> 00:36:11,402
They said all the right
things about how I was special

940
00:36:11,404 --> 00:36:12,970
because they chose me, but...

941
00:36:12,972 --> 00:36:14,355
sometimes I couldn't help but wonder

942
00:36:14,357 --> 00:36:17,441
what the rest of my family was like.

943
00:36:17,443 --> 00:36:19,110
Are you anything like I thought you'd be?

944
00:36:19,112 --> 00:36:21,412
Definitely not, but...

945
00:36:21,414 --> 00:36:24,248
I did think about you.

946
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:27,151
I'm sorry I ruined your restaurant opening.

947
00:36:27,153 --> 00:36:29,653
Hey, we got through it, right? (chuckles)

948
00:36:29,655 --> 00:36:32,990
Yeah, not before you went
all Gordon Ramsay on me.

949
00:36:32,992 --> 00:36:34,925
"I need my avocados now!"

950
00:36:34,927 --> 00:36:37,094
And you were like, "Help
me, I can't breathe!"

951
00:36:37,096 --> 00:36:38,996
(laughs) Oh, my God.

952
00:36:38,998 --> 00:36:42,466
(sighs) I think we got that
family memory you were going for.

953
00:36:42,468 --> 00:36:45,436
(chuckles)

954
00:36:45,438 --> 00:36:47,471
Wait, if you're allergic to argan oil,

955
00:36:47,473 --> 00:36:49,339
why do you use it in your cooking?

956
00:36:49,341 --> 00:36:50,875
Because it's the best.

957
00:36:50,877 --> 00:36:52,560
I only use the best.

958
00:36:52,562 --> 00:36:54,645
(chuckling): Oh.

959
00:36:54,647 --> 00:36:57,648
You and me are totally related.

960
00:36:58,483 --> 00:37:00,234
(knocking)

961
00:37:00,236 --> 00:37:02,036
- Knock knock.
- Hey.

962
00:37:02,038 --> 00:37:04,238
Hey.

963
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,908
You left so fast you forgot your camera.

964
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:10,544
(groans) Thanks.

965
00:37:12,214 --> 00:37:16,133
Not exactly a banner day
for my film-making career.

966
00:37:16,135 --> 00:37:20,588
Or my baby-making career, for that matter.

967
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:22,256
Look...

968
00:37:22,258 --> 00:37:26,060
(sighs) I know it was a hard day.

969
00:37:26,062 --> 00:37:29,513
But giving Noreen that
makeover felt really great.

970
00:37:29,515 --> 00:37:32,983
It feels really good giving
people their dream moment.

971
00:37:32,985 --> 00:37:34,401
(sighs)

972
00:37:34,403 --> 00:37:37,438
You could do the same thing for Michaela.

973
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:42,026
Hey.

974
00:37:42,028 --> 00:37:43,360
(beeping)

975
00:37:43,362 --> 00:37:45,529
I think you should watch this.

976
00:37:46,748 --> 00:37:48,749
Well...

977
00:37:48,751 --> 00:37:51,535
Okay.

978
00:37:51,537 --> 00:37:53,454
(clears throat)

979
00:37:53,456 --> 00:37:56,457
(mutters) Okay.

980
00:37:56,459 --> 00:37:58,375
Okay, so, this is a documentary

981
00:37:58,377 --> 00:37:59,927
about people's life story, right?

982
00:37:59,929 --> 00:38:02,680
Well, my story is...

983
00:38:02,682 --> 00:38:04,381
I screwed, okay?

984
00:38:04,383 --> 00:38:06,884
I should've told you about
Michaela from the beginning.

985
00:38:06,886 --> 00:38:09,386
I guess I was just scared
that I might lose her

986
00:38:09,388 --> 00:38:11,021
because she might be my last chance.

987
00:38:11,023 --> 00:38:12,523
Just like she is for you.

988
00:38:12,525 --> 00:38:14,441
So... I... I figured out a way

989
00:38:14,443 --> 00:38:16,110
to make all of our dreams come true.

990
00:38:16,112 --> 00:38:18,612
No tours, no clubs.

991
00:38:18,614 --> 00:38:23,317
I want us to make a music video.
And I want you to be the director.

992
00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:25,319
'Cause, honestly, Silver,

993
00:38:25,321 --> 00:38:27,905
you're one of the most
talented people I know.

994
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:36,664
(footsteps approaching)

995
00:38:36,666 --> 00:38:39,667
Hey. Drunky.

996
00:38:39,669 --> 00:38:41,835
It's almost 11:00.

997
00:38:43,221 --> 00:38:46,290
(groaning)

998
00:38:46,292 --> 00:38:50,394
(hisses) Oh, this
hangover makes it official.

999
00:38:50,396 --> 00:38:52,096
My beer is terrible.

1000
00:38:52,098 --> 00:38:54,398
(chuckles) Well, at least you tried.

1001
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,568
(sighs) Hey.

1002
00:38:57,570 --> 00:39:00,221
Did we talk last night?

1003
00:39:02,157 --> 00:39:04,408
No. (chuckles)

1004
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:06,443
(door opens)

1005
00:39:06,445 --> 00:39:08,662
(door closes)

1006
00:39:10,532 --> 00:39:12,833
The engagement's off!

1007
00:39:12,835 --> 00:39:15,286
You're not the person
I thought I knew at all.

1008
00:39:16,154 --> 00:39:17,671
(sighs)

1009
00:39:17,673 --> 00:39:19,006
CAMPBELL: Shirazi.

1010
00:39:19,008 --> 00:39:21,041
- You really sold me out.
- You sold yourself out.

1011
00:39:21,043 --> 00:39:23,210
You were the one who was
caught studying with your ex.

1012
00:39:23,212 --> 00:39:24,511
Hey, you can forget about Cronus

1013
00:39:24,513 --> 00:39:25,796
and everything that goes along with it.

1014
00:39:25,798 --> 00:39:26,797
You're done.

1015
00:39:26,799 --> 00:39:27,932
Yeah, I figured. You know,

1016
00:39:27,874 --> 00:39:29,290
I bought into the whole
brotherhood business.

1017
00:39:29,292 --> 00:39:31,375
But I don't need help
from a brother like you.

1018
00:39:31,377 --> 00:39:32,409
What, you think you're better than me?

1019
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:33,577
Yeah, I do. For the simple fact

1020
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:34,879
that I don't have to lie, cheat

1021
00:39:34,881 --> 00:39:35,963
or scam my way through life.

1022
00:39:35,965 --> 00:39:37,965
Wow. You're really a nice guy.

1023
00:39:37,967 --> 00:39:39,917
But I got news for you...

1024
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,719
nice guys finish last.

1025
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:49,677
DIXON: Oh, man, this
swell has been dope lately.

1026
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:52,429
You ready for me to school
you, Mr. Court of No Appeal?

1027
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:54,798
Man, keep talking. I'm gonna
be dropping in on your waves

1028
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,569
- all day.
- Whoa, whoa. Touchy. Look, I'm just joking.

1029
00:39:58,571 --> 00:40:00,321
So what, okay? Brewmaster isn't your thing.

1030
00:40:00,323 --> 00:40:01,689
Then what is?

1031
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:02,990
I mean, I know this whole

1032
00:40:02,992 --> 00:40:04,858
beer thing was not my life's work, but...

1033
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,994
I don't want to be what
Annie said, you know? That guy

1034
00:40:06,996 --> 00:40:09,330
that's just sitting around
waiting for life to happen.

1035
00:40:09,332 --> 00:40:11,916
You know, I... I want to
find something that I love.

1036
00:40:11,918 --> 00:40:14,952
Something I'm... really
passionate about, you know?

1037
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,620
Yeah, yeah. Well...

1038
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,322
while you're waiting to find
that, maybe you should...

1039
00:40:18,324 --> 00:40:20,207
get busy making me one
of these custom boards.

1040
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,675
Dude, I'm telling you,

1041
00:40:21,677 --> 00:40:22,876
that thing is so sweet, man.

1042
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:24,628
If I had money, I'd pay for it.

1043
00:40:25,496 --> 00:40:26,764
Really?

1044
00:40:26,766 --> 00:40:27,798
Yeah.

1045
00:40:28,633 --> 00:40:29,883
How much?

1046
00:40:43,365 --> 00:40:46,083
Wow. Annie, once again
your writing surprises me.

1047
00:40:46,085 --> 00:40:49,320
(chuckles) I was up
all night working on it,

1048
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:51,372
and it took me a while, but...

1049
00:40:51,374 --> 00:40:54,241
I think I finally found the
ending that I really want.

1050
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:56,243
Well, it's better than I expected.

1051
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:59,246
When Annabelle tells Leo
how she feels and they kiss

1052
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,215
and then he sweeps her up in his arms

1053
00:41:01,217 --> 00:41:03,700
and rides off with her on his motorcycle?

1054
00:41:03,702 --> 00:41:05,919
Chills.

1055
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:09,139
It feels perfect 'cause it feels true.

1056
00:41:09,141 --> 00:41:11,091
Thanks.

1057
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:13,811
But, um... it's not.

1058
00:41:13,813 --> 00:41:16,563
At least not right now.

1059
00:41:20,885 --> 00:41:22,736
(sighs)
