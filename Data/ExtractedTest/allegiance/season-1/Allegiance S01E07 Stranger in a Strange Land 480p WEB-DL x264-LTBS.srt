1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,412
Previously on Allegiance...

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,810
The moment we have enough
information to prove

3
00:00:06,898 --> 00:00:09,019
that Black Dagger is real,
we go straight the FBI.

4
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:10,503
We work together as a family.

5
00:00:10,623 --> 00:00:12,464
The money for Black Dagger
will end up in Italy.

6
00:00:12,492 --> 00:00:14,064
The transfers arrive at a bank

7
00:00:14,103 --> 00:00:15,221
in Rome in three days.

8
00:00:15,238 --> 00:00:17,308
Someone must be there to
identify who picks it up.

9
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,555
If we can't get Alex to Rome,

10
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:20,191
we lose the trail on Black Dagger,

11
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:21,771
and it's the only trail we have.

12
00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:22,812
The drive.

13
00:00:25,318 --> 00:00:26,733
The documents on the flash drive

14
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:28,679
you found at the apartment
were SVR-encrypted.

15
00:00:28,799 --> 00:00:32,064
The SVR believes Mikhail passed
the stolen files to a broker.

16
00:00:32,112 --> 00:00:34,000
- Where's his broker?
- Rome, Italy.

17
00:00:34,025 --> 00:00:36,089
Why send a a task force
halfway around the world

18
00:00:36,113 --> 00:00:38,187
chasing files that
don't even exist anymore?

19
00:00:38,209 --> 00:00:39,918
- It wasn't our call.
- Whose call was it then?

20
00:00:39,992 --> 00:00:40,865
Mine.

21
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,772
It's nice to finally meet you, Alex.

22
00:00:49,981 --> 00:00:53,860
_

23
00:01:07,862 --> 00:01:10,112
Alex, talk to me. What's going on?

24
00:01:10,694 --> 00:01:13,043
Alex, stop. Go back.

25
00:01:16,372 --> 00:01:18,271
Alex, Alex, go back.

26
00:01:22,905 --> 00:01:24,670
Alex, can you hear me?

27
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,760
Please tell me what's going on.

28
00:01:30,603 --> 00:01:31,725
Alex, talk to me!

29
00:01:31,762 --> 00:01:34,339
- No, no, no.
- Alex, what's going on? Alex!

30
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:37,171
- I have to go.
- Alex, can you hear me?

31
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:42,895
What's going on?

32
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:44,876
- What's wrong? What happened?
- I don't know.

33
00:02:21,528 --> 00:02:23,220
It's nice to finally meet you, Alex.

34
00:02:24,142 --> 00:02:25,265
I'm Victor Dobrynin.

35
00:02:26,358 --> 00:02:28,168
_

36
00:02:36,057 --> 00:02:37,160
Please excuse us.

37
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,882
- We all need to find...
- Katya.

38
00:02:48,997 --> 00:02:51,541
I've been wanting to talk
to you for a long time.

39
00:02:51,968 --> 00:02:53,835
I do not like shadow games.

40
00:02:55,018 --> 00:02:56,430
- I thought that we...
- What's Black Dagger?

41
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,113
Black Dagger?

42
00:03:00,535 --> 00:03:02,408
It's a nuclear accident.

43
00:03:02,747 --> 00:03:04,570
It's an Ebola outbreak.

44
00:03:05,276 --> 00:03:06,217
It's a cyber virus...

45
00:03:06,222 --> 00:03:07,943
it knocks out the power grid for a month.

46
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,160
Or cuts off fresh water to the East Coast.

47
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,212
It's the thing that can't
be traced back to Russia.

48
00:03:13,491 --> 00:03:16,056
It makes the neighborhood
kids afraid to go outside.

49
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,517
What is it specifically?

50
00:03:19,538 --> 00:03:22,098
You don't know. You're just a foot soldier.

51
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:28,553
The SVR will wire a payment of $50 million

52
00:03:28,673 --> 00:03:30,263
to someone in Rome.

53
00:03:30,747 --> 00:03:32,414
It's an operation payment

54
00:03:33,216 --> 00:03:35,627
to a very high-end contractor.

55
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:37,684
If we mark the triggerman there,

56
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:39,508
we can stop Black Dagger before it starts.

57
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,165
You keep saying we, but you can't go,

58
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:43,303
- and neither can my parents.
- That's right, we can't.

59
00:03:43,529 --> 00:03:44,685
The SVR would track that

60
00:03:44,701 --> 00:03:45,684
and the moment they realize

61
00:03:45,685 --> 00:03:47,227
we were in the same city as the triggerman,

62
00:03:47,247 --> 00:03:48,102
they'd kill us all.

63
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:50,295
You planted those documents
the task force just found,

64
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:52,482
the documents saying
Mikhail's files were in Rome,

65
00:03:52,664 --> 00:03:54,527
all as an excuse to get me there?

66
00:03:55,656 --> 00:03:56,562
That's right.

67
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:57,959
And then what?

68
00:03:58,533 --> 00:04:00,627
I just slip away from my colleagues,

69
00:04:00,652 --> 00:04:02,627
all trained spies and spycatchers,

70
00:04:02,657 --> 00:04:04,192
and go and track an SVR contractor

71
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:06,490
skilled enough to command
a payment of $50 million?

72
00:04:08,187 --> 00:04:08,996
Yes.

73
00:04:14,024 --> 00:04:16,038
I cannot promise it will
be available for long.

74
00:04:16,058 --> 00:04:16,897
I have many suitors.

75
00:04:16,917 --> 00:04:19,934
I'm sure you do, Endo, but I want it more.

76
00:04:19,973 --> 00:04:22,448
For yourself or for the Chinese MSS?

77
00:04:22,844 --> 00:04:24,217
Does it matter?

78
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:26,875
If you have secondary market plans,

79
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:28,292
it matters a great a deal.

80
00:04:28,314 --> 00:04:31,461
The MSS wants it and we
want to keep it for ourself.

81
00:04:31,662 --> 00:04:33,080
Meet two days from now.

82
00:04:33,119 --> 00:04:34,627
We will contact you when you're here.

83
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:40,620
Rome.

84
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,581
Two days.

85
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:42,627
Nice. Close.

86
00:04:42,747 --> 00:04:44,228
You Hoovers even have passports?

87
00:04:44,247 --> 00:04:45,846
And it says I work for the FBI on it.

88
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,218
Think that's a problem for a covert-op?

89
00:04:47,261 --> 00:04:48,978
Endo's no dummy, so build legends.

90
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:49,746
Keep them tight.

91
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:52,627
Do we get to do one of those
fancy accents like yours?

92
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:54,152
Only if you can kill it, like me.

93
00:04:54,831 --> 00:04:56,890
You know what I'm talking about, O'Connor.

94
00:04:57,747 --> 00:04:58,455
Sir.

95
00:04:58,747 --> 00:04:59,565
Rome, kid.

96
00:04:59,887 --> 00:05:00,747
Get ready.

97
00:05:06,866 --> 00:05:10,590
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

98
00:05:17,306 --> 00:05:19,385
You now have two different missions.

99
00:05:19,505 --> 00:05:21,236
The cover with the CIA,

100
00:05:21,295 --> 00:05:23,751
collecting the bogus files
from the Italian broker,

101
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:27,154
and the real one to see who
picks up the SVR's money.

102
00:05:27,204 --> 00:05:29,862
This is crazy. I'm not
an operator. I don't...

103
00:05:29,925 --> 00:05:32,729
operate. I just tag
along with people who do.

104
00:05:33,087 --> 00:05:35,538
And now I'm putting my
mentor at risk for no reason.

105
00:05:35,555 --> 00:05:37,056
This is a limited mission.

106
00:05:37,176 --> 00:05:39,052
We can teach you
everything you need to know.

107
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,567
And Sam Luttrell has 25 years in the field.

108
00:05:41,747 --> 00:05:43,373
He can take care of himself.

109
00:05:43,493 --> 00:05:45,844
But you're going to need
to slip away from the CIA.

110
00:05:45,964 --> 00:05:47,501
We'll be on comms to help

111
00:05:47,562 --> 00:05:50,083
and a contact in the field will assist you.

112
00:05:50,153 --> 00:05:50,826
Who?

113
00:05:50,946 --> 00:05:52,446
His name is Fadi.

114
00:05:52,464 --> 00:05:55,139
He's crossing in from
Beirut to back you up.

115
00:05:55,196 --> 00:05:56,715
I've known him a long time.

116
00:05:56,747 --> 00:05:58,519
He's somebody that we can trust.

117
00:05:58,543 --> 00:06:00,005
You're gonna need field backup.

118
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:02,523
All you're doing is marking
the target and reporting back.

119
00:06:03,394 --> 00:06:05,420
We'll make a plan to
detain him at a later time.

120
00:06:06,052 --> 00:06:07,496
And if he makes us, what do I do?

121
00:06:07,747 --> 00:06:08,692
You call it off.

122
00:06:08,748 --> 00:06:10,509
You disappear immediately.

123
00:06:14,086 --> 00:06:14,764
Okay.

124
00:06:15,747 --> 00:06:17,025
Okay, I can do this.

125
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:19,768
If you need an excuse to get
away from your colleagues,

126
00:06:20,594 --> 00:06:23,514
this is a last resort if
you need to leave in a hurry.

127
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:26,491
The green pill is a tartar emetic.

128
00:06:26,508 --> 00:06:27,971
It simulates food poisoning.

129
00:06:27,993 --> 00:06:31,081
The blue pill, the calming
blue, that's the antidote.

130
00:06:31,201 --> 00:06:32,959
It's a cyclizine antiemetic.

131
00:06:34,417 --> 00:06:35,747
Okay?

132
00:06:39,747 --> 00:06:41,802
I'm subverting the CIA,

133
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:44,358
running an off-book mission,

134
00:06:45,165 --> 00:06:47,584
intentionally giving them false leads.

135
00:06:52,124 --> 00:06:54,103
What I'm about to do is treasonous.

136
00:07:15,747 --> 00:07:17,469
The little green man
still out there on the wing

137
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,923
tearing apart the hydraulics?

138
00:07:19,423 --> 00:07:21,734
Sharp claws, fangs.

139
00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:23,275
No.

140
00:07:25,747 --> 00:07:26,627
We're married.

141
00:07:27,454 --> 00:07:29,210
It was a lovely ceremony.

142
00:07:30,172 --> 00:07:31,863
I made associate at my firm by 25.

143
00:07:31,902 --> 00:07:33,492
That's why I fell for you, big boy.

144
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:35,056
You're a star.

145
00:08:07,323 --> 00:08:09,865
1998, History, magna cum laude.

146
00:08:09,985 --> 00:08:11,627
Summa. You memorized all our legends,

147
00:08:11,647 --> 00:08:12,987
didn't you, freak show?

148
00:08:13,747 --> 00:08:14,801
I read them.

149
00:08:15,747 --> 00:08:16,991
Do we know the restaurant layout?

150
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:17,867
We're getting pictures.

151
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:19,211
I'll meet with Endo,

152
00:08:19,219 --> 00:08:20,757
he'll do his little broker dancer,

153
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,739
try and show me how big his
huevos are, then give me a price.

154
00:08:22,748 --> 00:08:24,374
- You two are strictly backup.
- Man and wife.

155
00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:25,919
Okay, we got at 9:00 a.m.,

156
00:08:25,941 --> 00:08:27,496
so easy on the mini-bar tonight.

157
00:08:27,513 --> 00:08:28,884
I'm looking at you, Rain Man.

158
00:08:29,263 --> 00:08:30,627
- I don't drink alcohol.
- Holy balls.

159
00:08:30,656 --> 00:08:32,824
Alex, recognize when
someone is yanking you.

160
00:08:33,167 --> 00:08:34,488
Now get the hell out of my room. Go.

161
00:08:50,066 --> 00:08:50,885
Fadi?

162
00:08:51,005 --> 00:08:53,740
I knew you were Katya's child from 50 feet.

163
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,258
I only have a few minutes before
my colleagues know I'm gone.

164
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:02,832
I was told you'd have a weapon for me.

165
00:09:13,516 --> 00:09:14,377
Where's the bank?

166
00:09:15,476 --> 00:09:17,392
I have someone inside
waiting for the operative

167
00:09:17,409 --> 00:09:19,630
in charge of Black Dagger to arrive.

168
00:09:20,118 --> 00:09:21,383
Whoever the money's intended for,

169
00:09:21,404 --> 00:09:22,476
we don't want it sitting there long.

170
00:09:22,971 --> 00:09:23,529
Yes.

171
00:09:23,926 --> 00:09:25,219
But he'll need to know it's safe

172
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,494
before he withdraws it.

173
00:09:26,747 --> 00:09:27,822
We don't need to assume it's a man,

174
00:09:27,843 --> 00:09:29,048
or even just one person.

175
00:09:31,285 --> 00:09:32,747
Have you used one of those before?

176
00:09:32,867 --> 00:09:35,568
Sig Sauer P226 double-action 9mm.

177
00:09:35,582 --> 00:09:37,522
Picatinny rail, vertical
front strap serrations.

178
00:09:39,268 --> 00:09:40,656
Not once, while shooting a man,

179
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,385
has it occurred to me where
the grip of my gun is made.

180
00:09:44,395 --> 00:09:45,627
Why are you doing this?

181
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,497
Taking all these risks for us?

182
00:09:48,217 --> 00:09:49,457
Dental floss.

183
00:09:52,481 --> 00:09:54,260
Beirut, in the late '80s,

184
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,834
I led an Op straight
into a scouting patrol.

185
00:09:56,886 --> 00:10:00,022
I took two of your Sig
9mms below my ribcage.

186
00:10:00,069 --> 00:10:01,963
We were cornered. No evac.

187
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,377
I would've bled out,

188
00:10:03,693 --> 00:10:05,854
but a young recruit cut out the bullet,

189
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,980
took out a twine of dental
floss, and sewed me up.

190
00:10:09,815 --> 00:10:11,672
She sat with me through the night.

191
00:10:12,076 --> 00:10:13,275
My mother did that?

192
00:10:13,921 --> 00:10:15,746
She was on an Op that got into a firefight?

193
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,149
She's an extraordinary woman.

194
00:10:19,317 --> 00:10:20,964
Katya doesn't have to mention the risks

195
00:10:20,999 --> 00:10:22,533
when she asks for a favor.

196
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:25,627
Now, go back and help your CIA friends

197
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,288
with their wild goose chase.

198
00:10:27,548 --> 00:10:29,707
Don't worry. I will watch the bank.

199
00:10:32,681 --> 00:10:36,130
I don't speak Mandarin, so I
assume you said I look beautiful.

200
00:10:37,216 --> 00:10:38,758
All clear. No signs of Endo.

201
00:10:41,948 --> 00:10:43,746
You know, the Tempietto Del Bramante

202
00:10:43,747 --> 00:10:45,816
is considered one of the great
architectural pieces of Europe.

203
00:10:45,834 --> 00:10:47,884
- If there's time...
- What, you want to culture me?

204
00:10:48,258 --> 00:10:50,628
I would like to see the
Tempietto Del Bramante.

205
00:10:50,915 --> 00:10:53,022
So you don't want to culture me?

206
00:10:53,962 --> 00:10:55,307
I would like to.

207
00:10:55,952 --> 00:10:56,738
Yes.

208
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:00,494
Excuse me, sir, it's for you.

209
00:11:04,273 --> 00:11:05,854
I told you to come alone.

210
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:07,434
I am.

211
00:11:07,463 --> 00:11:08,970
Then who's the couple in the corner?

212
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,984
They finished breakfast an hour ago.

213
00:11:11,006 --> 00:11:11,949
The deal's off.

214
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:25,177
_

215
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,850
Let's go back to the hotel.

216
00:11:43,489 --> 00:11:44,816
I have an agent gone dark.

217
00:11:53,301 --> 00:11:55,501
I apologize for the abduction.

218
00:11:56,256 --> 00:11:57,995
But you did break my rules.

219
00:11:58,115 --> 00:12:00,535
Would you ever go to a buy without backup?

220
00:12:00,535 --> 00:12:01,746
I would never buy.

221
00:12:01,866 --> 00:12:02,917
I only sell.

222
00:12:03,227 --> 00:12:04,976
Well, it's good to be king.

223
00:12:04,998 --> 00:12:06,688
Better to be a king-maker.

224
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:09,192
Which is why it's so important

225
00:12:09,214 --> 00:12:10,725
I know who my buyers are.

226
00:12:10,845 --> 00:12:14,159
The MSS wants your SVR Intel.

227
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,627
And they sent you from London?

228
00:12:15,644 --> 00:12:16,553
Closer branch.

229
00:12:16,895 --> 00:12:18,525
You went to Qingdao for your training?

230
00:12:18,547 --> 00:12:19,763
Of course.

231
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,958
Who was your instructor
at the base in Qingdao?

232
00:12:27,971 --> 00:12:28,858
Shu Chen.

233
00:12:28,876 --> 00:12:29,627
His rank?

234
00:12:29,747 --> 00:12:30,944
Leftenant Colonel.

235
00:12:30,971 --> 00:12:33,163
What color was the outdoor track?

236
00:12:35,747 --> 00:12:38,417
There was no outdoor track on base.

237
00:12:42,974 --> 00:12:44,942
Now I can take you through primary school

238
00:12:44,968 --> 00:12:47,446
and get you a copy of my
mother's last angiogram,

239
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:50,598
or we can just get to it,
and tell me your price.

240
00:12:50,616 --> 00:12:52,285
Have you tried the saltimbocca?

241
00:12:52,347 --> 00:12:54,727
Meat so tender, you'll swear it's alive.

242
00:12:55,522 --> 00:12:56,812
Be sure to try it.

243
00:13:16,528 --> 00:13:17,917
You didn't miss a background cue?

244
00:13:20,221 --> 00:13:21,656
If I had, local PD would be

245
00:13:21,697 --> 00:13:24,389
pulling a very handsome Asian
floater out of the Tiber River.

246
00:13:24,455 --> 00:13:25,530
You said he was drinking tea.

247
00:13:25,544 --> 00:13:27,392
Do you remember if it was
loose leafed or bagged?

248
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:30,164
Loose.

249
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:31,949
The chair was wood and the wall was stone.

250
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,411
Now stop trying to debrief me.

251
00:13:33,463 --> 00:13:35,237
Look, maybe we should
go back to the restaurant

252
00:13:35,251 --> 00:13:37,939
- and do a sweep for any...
- There's nothing to do until Endo calls.

253
00:13:37,971 --> 00:13:38,575
Now...

254
00:13:39,406 --> 00:13:41,021
I feel like I have an ice pick in my eye,

255
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,994
so if you don't stop talking and go away,

256
00:13:43,017 --> 00:13:45,273
they'll be putting up a
star for you at Langley.

257
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,156
Hey.

258
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,600
After all that with Sam,

259
00:14:04,617 --> 00:14:06,115
I thought you might've
forgotten your legend.

260
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:07,605
Want to run over it again?

261
00:14:09,427 --> 00:14:10,703
No, I know every word of it.

262
00:14:10,723 --> 00:14:12,430
Why would you think I would need to...

263
00:14:12,815 --> 00:14:14,144
Easy, Gunpowder, I'm kidding.

264
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,747
Oh, your view is better than mine.

265
00:14:19,945 --> 00:14:20,813
I doubt that.

266
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:22,772
I just said it was.

267
00:14:25,814 --> 00:14:27,126
Why are you looking at me like that?

268
00:14:28,594 --> 00:14:29,158
Like what?

269
00:14:29,434 --> 00:14:30,155
Like that.

270
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,332
I don't know any other way to look at you.

271
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:36,258
Really? Because I could get the wrong idea

272
00:14:36,286 --> 00:14:37,380
of what you're thinking.

273
00:14:39,035 --> 00:14:40,444
What does it look like I'm thinking?

274
00:14:43,178 --> 00:14:44,741
That you want to put your hands on me.

275
00:14:48,206 --> 00:14:50,436
I want to put my hands on
you every time I see you.

276
00:14:53,939 --> 00:14:55,693
So do something then.

277
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:42,711
Here.

278
00:16:01,747 --> 00:16:03,549
I did not see this happening.

279
00:16:04,051 --> 00:16:05,828
Well, that's part of your charm, Alex.

280
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,844
And we're in the city of romance.

281
00:16:09,021 --> 00:16:10,347
I think that's Paris.

282
00:16:11,787 --> 00:16:12,595
Shut up.

283
00:16:13,917 --> 00:16:14,746
No, you're...

284
00:16:14,747 --> 00:16:15,805
you're right. It's...

285
00:16:16,363 --> 00:16:17,346
it's probably Rome.

286
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:18,883
Better.

287
00:16:30,468 --> 00:16:31,090
Yes?

288
00:16:31,364 --> 00:16:32,018
He's here...

289
00:16:32,183 --> 00:16:33,701
your Black Dagger operative.

290
00:16:34,365 --> 00:16:35,746
He's draining the account.

291
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:36,880
I'll try and get away.

292
00:16:36,907 --> 00:16:39,627
I'll have my inside man stall,
but you must hurry, my friend.

293
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:47,667
We probably shouldn't
say anything about this.

294
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:51,329
Which isn't saying it was a mistake.

295
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:25,372
He's on the move.

296
00:17:25,492 --> 00:17:26,934
I'm coming.

297
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:30,085
Hey!

298
00:17:30,434 --> 00:17:32,463
He's in a black range rover.

299
00:17:32,946 --> 00:17:34,696
Is anyone with him?

300
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:36,627
Just his driver.

301
00:17:36,696 --> 00:17:38,530
Do you have the tracking device ready?

302
00:17:38,747 --> 00:17:40,512
Just get me close enough!

303
00:18:03,328 --> 00:18:04,492
Where are you?

304
00:18:04,612 --> 00:18:06,370
Villa Nardone, by the tower.

305
00:18:06,408 --> 00:18:08,634
No, rear-end him. You have
to stall. I need to catch up.

306
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:09,912
Stall the driver!

307
00:18:22,748 --> 00:18:24,540
Excusi.

308
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,486
_

309
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:41,263
Excusi.

310
00:18:44,447 --> 00:18:46,309
Momento, momento!

311
00:18:46,747 --> 00:18:50,082
Signore, per favore...

312
00:18:50,639 --> 00:18:51,948
Momento, momento!

313
00:18:57,256 --> 00:18:58,794
_

314
00:19:00,595 --> 00:19:01,650
Per favore.

315
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:09,739
You're okay?

316
00:19:10,437 --> 00:19:11,091
Yeah.

317
00:19:22,515 --> 00:19:24,450
You sure we shouldn't get a little closer?

318
00:19:25,844 --> 00:19:27,526
This is a world-class operative.

319
00:19:27,747 --> 00:19:29,463
Any closer, he'll make us.

320
00:19:34,136 --> 00:19:36,301
That's a chop shop for stolen cars.

321
00:19:38,098 --> 00:19:40,096
Your man is with Camorra Italian Mafia.

322
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,379
This is a front.

323
00:19:41,585 --> 00:19:42,977
There's no way a Camorra mobster

324
00:19:43,004 --> 00:19:44,627
would be carrying out
an attack for the SVR.

325
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:45,990
He's likely a cut-out.

326
00:19:46,012 --> 00:19:47,589
A middleman delivering it to someone else.

327
00:19:47,589 --> 00:19:50,558
They've carried out bombings
and assassinations before,

328
00:19:50,747 --> 00:19:52,916
supported, at times, by your own CIA.

329
00:19:53,681 --> 00:19:55,719
Not that your history books will admit it.

330
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:58,082
That's an exaggeration.

331
00:19:58,285 --> 00:20:01,020
Oh, we all start out as idealists.

332
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,822
Then we see how the world actually works.

333
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,746
I'm not as naive as you think.

334
00:20:08,345 --> 00:20:09,123
What?

335
00:20:10,547 --> 00:20:12,728
I'm just remembering when I was your age.

336
00:20:12,882 --> 00:20:14,263
Beginning this life.

337
00:20:16,964 --> 00:20:18,710
What was she like back then, my mother?

338
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,219
She didn't choose this like you did.

339
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:23,513
Her father made the decision for her.

340
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:26,578
She was determined not to
live her life defined by it,

341
00:20:27,522 --> 00:20:29,311
which is not always so easy.

342
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,627
I will wait for our target to move

343
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:34,386
and see if there's another triggerman.

344
00:20:35,078 --> 00:20:38,503
You go back and join
your American CIA friends.

345
00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:51,747
I just hope your genius brother
doesn't outsmart himself.

346
00:20:51,747 --> 00:20:53,247
Give himself away.

347
00:20:53,367 --> 00:20:55,207
It's all going to escalate quickly.

348
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,425
The Rezident isn't stupid. He's worse.

349
00:20:58,685 --> 00:20:59,572
He's paranoid.

350
00:21:01,565 --> 00:21:02,928
We know the risks.

351
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,095
So does Alex.

352
00:21:06,026 --> 00:21:07,899
Alex isn't who I'm worried about.

353
00:21:10,358 --> 00:21:11,310
When we have to,

354
00:21:12,691 --> 00:21:13,826
when there's nothing else,

355
00:21:15,511 --> 00:21:16,460
we run.

356
00:21:47,549 --> 00:21:48,726
Emergency stash.

357
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,259
If we have to leave suddenly,

358
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:03,829
this is the meeting spot.

359
00:22:27,548 --> 00:22:29,889
You ever think of putting in some carpet?

360
00:22:29,917 --> 00:22:31,886
It will open the place up.

361
00:22:32,545 --> 00:22:34,648
The price is 15 million euros.

362
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:36,697
You've got to be kidding.

363
00:22:36,998 --> 00:22:38,690
That's three times its worth.

364
00:22:38,962 --> 00:22:39,805
I agree.

365
00:22:39,957 --> 00:22:41,514
But you will pay it, if you want it.

366
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,627
I have other interested parties.

367
00:22:43,861 --> 00:22:44,787
Not for that rate.

368
00:22:45,288 --> 00:22:45,883
Maybe,

369
00:22:46,068 --> 00:22:47,825
but I give you first right to match.

370
00:22:48,219 --> 00:22:49,560
Say, five hours.

371
00:22:51,474 --> 00:22:53,228
There is no bargaining room here.

372
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:54,060
Five hours from...

373
00:22:55,212 --> 00:22:55,750
Sir...

374
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:57,946
Well, Endo's no dummy.

375
00:22:58,025 --> 00:22:59,323
He'll check and I guarantee you,

376
00:22:59,334 --> 00:23:01,414
he will get violent fast if he realizes...

377
00:23:03,308 --> 00:23:03,882
Yes, sir.

378
00:23:06,747 --> 00:23:07,878
They don't want to risk that much money.

379
00:23:07,998 --> 00:23:09,915
So, what, we just walk
away from a huge cache

380
00:23:09,926 --> 00:23:10,851
of SVR documents?

381
00:23:10,868 --> 00:23:12,330
No, they want me to buy it.

382
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:14,488
Just with a suitcase
full of counterfeit bills.

383
00:23:14,508 --> 00:23:16,205
But Endo's been around the block.

384
00:23:16,747 --> 00:23:19,430
He'll check the bills and if
he realizes they're counterfeit,

385
00:23:20,008 --> 00:23:21,618
he'll definitely try
to shoot me on the spot.

386
00:23:21,628 --> 00:23:23,272
Wait, what? That's... that's not worth it.

387
00:23:23,338 --> 00:23:24,314
Thanks for your concern, kid,

388
00:23:24,334 --> 00:23:25,498
but that's what Uncle Sam pays me for.

389
00:23:25,725 --> 00:23:27,707
Look, what if this cache
isn't what we think it is?

390
00:23:27,747 --> 00:23:29,288
Well, there's only one way to find out.

391
00:23:29,338 --> 00:23:31,144
And I think he'll try to shoot me.

392
00:23:31,171 --> 00:23:32,110
I didn't say he'd succeed.

393
00:23:32,154 --> 00:23:34,404
How do you avoid a bullet
fired at close range?

394
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:35,963
Quick reflexes.

395
00:23:36,486 --> 00:23:39,406
Plus, I'll spike the guy's
tea so his reflexes are slow.

396
00:23:39,445 --> 00:23:40,627
No, but there are two of them.

397
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,539
- Him and his guard...
- Alex, calm down.

398
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,084
Italian Intel will provide backup.

399
00:23:44,129 --> 00:23:46,109
Along with a couple of our own GRS guys,

400
00:23:46,127 --> 00:23:47,299
I should have at least

401
00:23:47,317 --> 00:23:48,669
eight friendly guns around me.

402
00:23:48,691 --> 00:23:50,627
How far away? They're not
gonna be in the room with you.

403
00:23:50,641 --> 00:23:52,718
Alex, your concern for
me is touching, really.

404
00:23:53,612 --> 00:23:54,553
I'm touched.

405
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:57,097
I am.

406
00:23:57,322 --> 00:23:59,724
Look, it doesn't matter
how many guns are around you

407
00:23:59,747 --> 00:24:01,217
if you can't stake out
the place in advance.

408
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:02,336
How are they gonna do that

409
00:24:02,364 --> 00:24:03,742
if you don't know where
he's gonna take you?

410
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:06,251
They took me to the same place twice.

411
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:07,711
You don't know where that is.

412
00:24:08,391 --> 00:24:10,624
Well, we're gonna have to figure
that out, aren't we, Einstein?

413
00:24:12,747 --> 00:24:14,759
Okay, we drove for about 40 minutes

414
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,783
across two sets of tram tracks.

415
00:24:16,796 --> 00:24:19,470
About five minutes before
Endo's, I smelled...

416
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,499
boots.

417
00:24:21,747 --> 00:24:22,619
Leather.

418
00:24:23,164 --> 00:24:23,927
Conceria.

419
00:24:24,259 --> 00:24:26,338
Well, there's a tannery
across from these tracks.

420
00:24:26,747 --> 00:24:28,746
The Trastevere region. What else?

421
00:24:29,431 --> 00:24:32,799
Um...

422
00:24:33,411 --> 00:24:35,129
Bells, I heard church bells.

423
00:24:35,145 --> 00:24:36,946
Luckily, there aren't a
lot of churches in Rome.

424
00:24:36,951 --> 00:24:39,345
I'm not done. There were
dozens of church bells

425
00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:41,426
playing some kind of
a melody. It was, uh...

426
00:24:41,906 --> 00:24:42,854
Carillon.

427
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,485
They're rare. Especially rare in Italy.

428
00:24:46,072 --> 00:24:48,180
Did you learn that in
your Ecclesiastical Music

429
00:24:48,185 --> 00:24:49,577
of Southern Europe class at Princeton?

430
00:24:49,595 --> 00:24:50,811
I mean, how the hell do you know that?

431
00:24:51,081 --> 00:24:51,506
I...

432
00:24:51,953 --> 00:24:52,957
I'm not sure.

433
00:24:53,168 --> 00:24:54,531
I used to read a lot as a kid.

434
00:24:54,651 --> 00:24:56,835
And it's the heaviest musical
instrument in the world,

435
00:24:56,875 --> 00:24:57,938
and I thought that was interesting.

436
00:24:58,058 --> 00:24:58,818
That carillons are heavy?

437
00:24:58,818 --> 00:25:00,251
That they're very rare in Italy.

438
00:25:00,316 --> 00:25:01,496
As in, only one.

439
00:25:03,747 --> 00:25:04,554
St. Paul's.

440
00:25:04,748 --> 00:25:05,746
Now we're getting somewhere.

441
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,665
Just before we stopped,

442
00:25:08,219 --> 00:25:09,523
we went over some bumps.

443
00:25:10,101 --> 00:25:10,958
Potholes?

444
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:14,469
No, it went from asphalt to cobblestone.

445
00:25:15,122 --> 00:25:16,588
Then I heard, like, a...

446
00:25:17,489 --> 00:25:20,180
a drone sound. Like a foghorn or something.

447
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,679
Foghorn? There's no harbor here.

448
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:24,286
I don't know what to tell you. Uh...

449
00:25:24,406 --> 00:25:26,297
All right, well, aside from the foghorn,

450
00:25:26,343 --> 00:25:28,198
I'd say you were somewhere
in this three-block area.

451
00:25:28,231 --> 00:25:30,023
In a restaurant. How do
you know it's a restaurant?

452
00:25:30,756 --> 00:25:33,007
You said Endo was drinking loose leaf tea.

453
00:25:33,045 --> 00:25:34,863
That suggests he was
somewhere that serves food.

454
00:25:34,885 --> 00:25:36,746
Otherwise, the tea would be in bags.

455
00:25:43,392 --> 00:25:45,355
No foghorns, no...

456
00:25:45,429 --> 00:25:47,959
hidden waterways that weren't on our maps.

457
00:25:49,303 --> 00:25:51,191
Maybe Sam had wax in his ears.

458
00:25:51,747 --> 00:25:54,120
Can I ask you what your tattoo means?

459
00:25:57,191 --> 00:25:59,261
It's for Jillian, my sister.

460
00:25:59,381 --> 00:26:00,785
She loved cats.

461
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:02,483
Loved?

462
00:26:03,917 --> 00:26:05,696
She only made it to 18.

463
00:26:05,816 --> 00:26:07,011
What happened?

464
00:26:07,426 --> 00:26:08,541
Car accident.

465
00:26:09,885 --> 00:26:12,230
I stopped praying for a
better life after that.

466
00:26:12,532 --> 00:26:14,200
I just try to live each a day as it comes.

467
00:26:16,406 --> 00:26:17,493
I'm sorry.

468
00:26:19,831 --> 00:26:21,884
When I got the ink, I
thought maybe it would

469
00:26:22,252 --> 00:26:23,971
make me feel closer to her.

470
00:26:25,213 --> 00:26:26,446
Sometimes it does.

471
00:26:31,488 --> 00:26:33,212
Sam's foghorn.

472
00:26:37,347 --> 00:26:38,401
He's late.

473
00:26:38,566 --> 00:26:40,746
A lot of paperwork to get
something like this approved.

474
00:26:40,747 --> 00:26:42,268
Especially in Italy.

475
00:26:43,148 --> 00:26:44,256
That, or somebody made him.

476
00:26:44,265 --> 00:26:45,486
Grabbed him off the street.

477
00:26:45,894 --> 00:26:47,739
Somebody's going to make
us if you don't start

478
00:26:47,747 --> 00:26:49,850
- living your cover, Alex.
- What?

479
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,984
You're on vacation with your wife.

480
00:26:52,285 --> 00:26:54,678
Look at the scenery. Take some pictures.

481
00:27:09,885 --> 00:27:11,060
Where did you come from?

482
00:27:11,367 --> 00:27:12,322
Behind you.

483
00:27:12,442 --> 00:27:14,650
What did I tell you about
always looking forward?

484
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:17,580
This is Magda, with GRS,
and Fernando, with AIASI.

485
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:18,805
Walk with us.

486
00:27:29,707 --> 00:27:31,085
Certainly would fool me.

487
00:27:32,342 --> 00:27:33,863
The application device.

488
00:27:42,747 --> 00:27:44,700
This is the best tech
services could come up with?

489
00:27:44,751 --> 00:27:45,831
On short notice, yes.

490
00:27:45,951 --> 00:27:47,900
- How fast will it work?
- Maybe a minute.

491
00:27:48,747 --> 00:27:50,769
They most likely had
you in the basement here.

492
00:27:50,986 --> 00:27:52,764
And those goons play
cards by the back exit.

493
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:55,281
So you'll have to go 40
feet through the main bar

494
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:57,086
and out the front doors if things go south.

495
00:27:57,125 --> 00:28:00,639
_

496
00:28:00,687 --> 00:28:02,321
_

497
00:28:02,544 --> 00:28:04,279
_

498
00:28:04,441 --> 00:28:06,277
_

499
00:28:06,339 --> 00:28:08,051
_

500
00:28:08,367 --> 00:28:09,175
Okay.

501
00:28:10,141 --> 00:28:11,340
We'll be outside, too.

502
00:28:19,469 --> 00:28:22,508
I am pleased the MSS
decide to meet the price.

503
00:28:23,986 --> 00:28:26,155
I must tell you, you were right

504
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:27,719
about the saltimbocca.

505
00:28:27,994 --> 00:28:29,855
- Delicious.
- Yeah.

506
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:34,833
Sirva here will oversee
the terms for your funds.

507
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:45,044
That's more people than
he expected in the room.

508
00:28:45,066 --> 00:28:46,620
He can handle it.

509
00:28:47,747 --> 00:28:49,322
We're ready at the back exit.

510
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:27,265
So?

511
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:30,141
They're excellent quality.

512
00:29:32,617 --> 00:29:34,275
But they're counterfeit.

513
00:29:40,747 --> 00:29:42,886
Prepare to engage.

514
00:29:44,856 --> 00:29:47,627
Excuse me, where the hell did you find him?

515
00:29:47,639 --> 00:29:50,318
Because he has no idea
what he's talking about.

516
00:29:50,351 --> 00:29:51,926
Test them again.

517
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,898
What were you thinking?

518
00:29:54,213 --> 00:29:56,965
Honestly, I was hoping...

519
00:29:58,358 --> 00:30:01,185
that you would've pitched
forward, lights out by now.

520
00:30:38,552 --> 00:30:40,083
The good news is, Intel is matching up

521
00:30:40,111 --> 00:30:41,829
to known SVR officers.

522
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,661
We seem to have a Russian
Easter egg on our hands.

523
00:30:44,991 --> 00:30:46,740
Bad news is, Langley is not happy

524
00:30:46,747 --> 00:30:48,264
that this thing ended in a firefight.

525
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:50,377
They're the ones that insisted
on using counterfeit, you...

526
00:30:50,926 --> 00:30:51,768
You warned them.

527
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:54,126
Well, you can tell the director
that in about five minutes.

528
00:30:54,162 --> 00:30:55,031
He and DNCS

529
00:30:55,058 --> 00:30:56,911
want a full debrief from us, pronto.

530
00:30:59,226 --> 00:31:00,864
The operative is on the movie, Alex.

531
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:02,107
You must hurry.

532
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:03,746
I'm about to go into
a debrief with Langley.

533
00:31:03,776 --> 00:31:05,243
- I can't just walk aw...
- I don't think the man

534
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:07,863
who's going to execute Black
Dagger cares about your debrief.

535
00:31:07,983 --> 00:31:08,857
Move.

536
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:43,627
Are you okay?

537
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:48,276
I think, uh...

538
00:31:48,588 --> 00:31:49,703
I'm not sure.

539
00:31:50,065 --> 00:31:52,036
You look like you should
go get some fresh air.

540
00:31:52,283 --> 00:31:53,996
Yeah, you look really pale.

541
00:32:03,828 --> 00:32:05,464
Yeah, okay. Uh...

542
00:32:05,636 --> 00:32:07,941
Look, why don't you just
go back to the hotel room?

543
00:32:07,951 --> 00:32:09,097
We'll field the call.

544
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:11,317
Don't worry. Langley knows it's your baby.

545
00:32:11,437 --> 00:32:13,295
Work's done here. So just, really,

546
00:32:13,488 --> 00:32:15,970
don't throw up in front
of people. Mainly me.

547
00:32:17,748 --> 00:32:18,885
Are you sure you're okay?

548
00:32:18,941 --> 00:32:21,890
I'm okay. I... I just...

549
00:32:23,702 --> 00:32:25,054
I just need to lie down.

550
00:32:25,672 --> 00:32:27,391
Yeah, go back to the hotel and rest.

551
00:32:27,418 --> 00:32:28,791
I'll check in on you later.

552
00:32:35,972 --> 00:32:37,855
Via Gallia. Hurry.

553
00:32:48,254 --> 00:32:51,295
No! Oh, God, no! No.

554
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:54,828
No!

555
00:32:54,902 --> 00:32:56,136
It's him. Alex?

556
00:32:56,171 --> 00:32:57,831
I lost the antidote pill.

557
00:32:57,906 --> 00:32:59,170
It's somewhere inside the seat.

558
00:32:59,241 --> 00:33:01,125
If I ask the driver to
stop, I'll never make it.

559
00:33:01,287 --> 00:33:02,183
What?

560
00:33:02,473 --> 00:33:03,904
How bad is this going to get?

561
00:33:03,953 --> 00:33:06,675
You're gonna be in agony
for about six hours.

562
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,223
Where is the triggerman now?

563
00:33:10,243 --> 00:33:11,444
He's on the move.

564
00:33:11,564 --> 00:33:12,906
Fadi just called.

565
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:13,973
Alex,

566
00:33:14,285 --> 00:33:15,172
get out of there.

567
00:33:15,225 --> 00:33:16,517
- Just leave it.
- No.

568
00:33:16,978 --> 00:33:19,853
No, I can't. We already
recovered the planted SVR data.

569
00:33:19,856 --> 00:33:21,789
- We'll be wheels up by tomorrow.
- No, Alex.

570
00:33:21,821 --> 00:33:23,219
This man is highly, highly trained.

571
00:33:23,242 --> 00:33:25,570
You're not gonna be able to
stand up in about ten minutes.

572
00:33:25,605 --> 00:33:26,746
You gotta let it go.

573
00:33:27,015 --> 00:33:27,959
There's too much at stake.

574
00:33:28,115 --> 00:33:30,336
No, Alex. Don't be stupid.

575
00:33:30,648 --> 00:33:31,746
I have to go.

576
00:33:31,771 --> 00:33:33,604
No, Alex.

577
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,544
The operative...

578
00:33:37,664 --> 00:33:39,411
He's meeting another man.

579
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:45,439
- Who?
- I don't know. I can't hear.

580
00:33:49,526 --> 00:33:51,555
He's exchanging the money for diamonds.

581
00:33:51,928 --> 00:33:53,513
Easier to transport.

582
00:33:59,284 --> 00:34:00,346
Hurry, my friend.

583
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:04,239
This is no cut-out. This is our man.

584
00:34:07,682 --> 00:34:09,466
He just released the driver.

585
00:34:09,586 --> 00:34:10,560
He's on foot now.

586
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:11,970
Where are you?

587
00:34:12,031 --> 00:34:13,850
Next to the Castel Sant'Angelo.

588
00:34:14,121 --> 00:34:16,089
Heading north of small building.

589
00:34:16,747 --> 00:34:18,144
I'm following him now.

590
00:34:56,747 --> 00:34:59,116
Alex, talk to me. What's going on?

591
00:34:59,539 --> 00:35:00,987
Alex, stop.

592
00:35:01,107 --> 00:35:02,178
Go back.

593
00:35:03,494 --> 00:35:05,532
Fadi's trailing the Black Dagger operative.

594
00:35:05,576 --> 00:35:06,876
I have to help him.

595
00:36:18,846 --> 00:36:20,054
Gunfire.

596
00:36:36,747 --> 00:36:38,973
Alex, can you hear me?

597
00:36:39,286 --> 00:36:41,026
Please, tell me what's going on.

598
00:36:45,124 --> 00:36:47,311
No! No. No. No.

599
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:49,727
What, what? God, what? What is it, Alex?

600
00:36:49,806 --> 00:36:51,760
What's wrong? What's wrong? Where are you?

601
00:36:51,931 --> 00:36:53,183
No. No.

602
00:36:53,214 --> 00:36:54,672
No, no... ah!

603
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:57,350
- What's going on?
- He's not saying... I can't hear him.

604
00:36:57,399 --> 00:36:59,348
He sounds far away, like he's drop...

605
00:36:59,388 --> 00:37:00,720
he's dropped the phone.

606
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:07,281
He's not the triggerman.

607
00:37:16,747 --> 00:37:17,591
The driver.

608
00:37:19,485 --> 00:37:20,533
I have to go.

609
00:37:21,182 --> 00:37:23,120
Alex!

610
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:25,668
Can you hear me?

611
00:37:31,678 --> 00:37:33,746
Alex, can you hear us?

612
00:37:33,747 --> 00:37:35,000
Alex. Alex can you hear us?

613
00:37:35,049 --> 00:37:36,613
He dropped the phone.

614
00:38:47,551 --> 00:38:49,930
Alex.

615
00:38:50,747 --> 00:38:52,197
Hey, did you make it back okay?

616
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:54,173
Michelle said you didn't answer her texts.

617
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:56,764
Alex?

618
00:39:00,747 --> 00:39:02,787
Okay, I'm courtesy-checking
now to make sure

619
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:04,962
you didn't stroke out in the bathtub.

620
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:08,257
Alex.

621
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:14,924
O'Connor.

622
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,309
The driver.

623
00:40:11,265 --> 00:40:12,945
It's Alex. Alex.

624
00:40:14,136 --> 00:40:15,366
I'm okay.

625
00:40:15,953 --> 00:40:17,144
He's okay.

626
00:40:18,193 --> 00:40:19,389
Fadi's dead.

627
00:40:19,592 --> 00:40:20,806
It was the driver the whole time.

628
00:40:20,839 --> 00:40:22,579
He was escorting his own cut-out.

629
00:40:24,635 --> 00:40:26,871
I let him get away and Fadi's dead.

630
00:40:28,463 --> 00:40:30,033
I screwed up everything.

631
00:40:30,439 --> 00:40:33,481
Alex, it's not your
fault. It's not your fault.

632
00:40:34,179 --> 00:40:35,079
Alex,

633
00:40:35,677 --> 00:40:36,835
you are alive.

634
00:40:37,461 --> 00:40:38,773
You are alive.

635
00:40:40,042 --> 00:40:41,875
Was there anything...

636
00:40:42,194 --> 00:40:45,356
Did you at least see
him? Anything about him?

637
00:41:28,491 --> 00:41:31,060
Mr. Kristoff, did you receive our package?

638
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:32,366
I did.

639
00:41:32,747 --> 00:41:33,910
Are you inbound?

640
00:41:35,293 --> 00:41:36,523
I have one more stop to make.

641
00:41:36,847 --> 00:41:38,077
I can be there in two days.

642
00:41:38,143 --> 00:41:39,663
And then I will be ready to start.
