1
00:00:01,018 --> 00:00:02,985
Previously on Allegiance...

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,187
- Alex O'Connor.
- You're Bill Adams.

3
00:00:05,222 --> 00:00:07,657
Don't use your real name with me.

4
00:00:07,691 --> 00:00:09,358
_

5
00:00:09,393 --> 00:00:11,427
Our comrades in Moscow have a task for you.

6
00:00:11,468 --> 00:00:13,770
You turn your son into a spy.

7
00:00:13,797 --> 00:00:16,198
An SVR defector was caught
last week and dealt with.

8
00:00:16,233 --> 00:00:18,534
The man had stolen hundreds
of thousands of computer files

9
00:00:18,568 --> 00:00:19,602
and hid them somewhere.

10
00:00:19,636 --> 00:00:21,270
You don't understand Alex.

11
00:00:21,305 --> 00:00:23,272
He'll turn us in the moment
he finds out who we are.

12
00:00:23,307 --> 00:00:24,974
Then you're stuck.

13
00:00:25,008 --> 00:00:27,109
An SVR officer said he was
close to launching an operation

14
00:00:27,144 --> 00:00:28,845
that would bring America to it's knees.

15
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:29,846
Do you know what an Easter egg is?

16
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,314
A hidden digital cache.

17
00:00:31,348 --> 00:00:32,782
I think there's a trove of information

18
00:00:32,816 --> 00:00:34,350
vital to the SVR still out there.

19
00:00:34,384 --> 00:00:36,018
Maybe if we can figure out who Mikhail was,

20
00:00:36,053 --> 00:00:37,720
we can find it before the Russians do.

21
00:00:37,754 --> 00:00:39,989
_

22
00:00:40,023 --> 00:00:42,658
You may actually be crazier than she is.

23
00:00:42,693 --> 00:00:44,527
They get what they want from
Alex without him knowing.

24
00:00:44,561 --> 00:00:45,995
He trusts us.

25
00:00:46,029 --> 00:00:49,031
We have access to his car,
his phone, his computer.

26
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:50,566
We're the perfect people to spy on him.

27
00:00:50,601 --> 00:00:52,301
Langley has our deceased
narrowed down to one name:

28
00:00:52,336 --> 00:00:53,536
Mikhail Vostrov.

29
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,371
I remember one time when I was a kid

30
00:00:55,405 --> 00:00:58,174
you called your friend
Nikolai "Mikhail" by mistake.

31
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:00,409
You can tell me everything,
or I can turn you in.

32
00:01:00,444 --> 00:01:02,712
Hey, Alex. Who died?

33
00:01:08,218 --> 00:01:10,887
You can tell me everything
from the beginning,

34
00:01:10,921 --> 00:01:14,023
or I can turn you in.

35
00:01:14,057 --> 00:01:15,491
_

36
00:01:15,526 --> 00:01:17,827
Everything's fine, Sarah. Go to your room.

37
00:01:17,861 --> 00:01:20,363
Seriously? You guys are all crazy...

38
00:01:20,397 --> 00:01:23,646
Go to your room, Sarah.

39
00:01:34,884 --> 00:01:36,847
Da?

40
00:01:44,721 --> 00:01:46,538
_

41
00:01:48,534 --> 00:01:49,901
This is impossible.

42
00:01:49,926 --> 00:01:51,694
He was like a brother to me growing up.

43
00:01:51,728 --> 00:01:54,897
If you grew up with him, then
you knew his name was Mikhail.

44
00:01:54,932 --> 00:01:56,198
Then why did you lie about it?

45
00:01:56,233 --> 00:02:00,169
Alex, I lost touch with Mikhail in 1975

46
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:04,307
when I was sent outside Russia
to go to boarding school.

47
00:02:04,341 --> 00:02:08,177
12 years later, I'm walking
down 5th Avenue with your father,

48
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:11,647
and I see Mikhail across the street.

49
00:02:11,682 --> 00:02:14,350
I yelled out his name, I ran to him.

50
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:18,154
Instead of a smile and a hug,

51
00:02:18,188 --> 00:02:20,656
he told me that he was living
here under an assumed name

52
00:02:20,691 --> 00:02:22,091
after barely escaping arrest...

53
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,159
So the whole house is bugged?

54
00:02:23,193 --> 00:02:25,461
_

55
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:32,401
Mikhail is a dissident,
Alex. He is not a spy.

56
00:02:32,436 --> 00:02:35,237
Dissidents don't do the
things listed in that file.

57
00:02:35,272 --> 00:02:38,116
He was no dissident. He was a Russian spy.

58
00:02:38,141 --> 00:02:40,679
_

59
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:43,021
_

60
00:02:43,046 --> 00:02:44,646
Katya, maybe Alex is right. Maybe he...

61
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:48,153
Wh... what are you talking
about? You know Mikhail.

62
00:02:48,885 --> 00:02:50,919
Well, he bumped into us
nine months after I started

63
00:02:50,954 --> 00:02:52,654
at Roche Aerospace.

64
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:54,490
I just started working on
their most classified project.

65
00:02:54,524 --> 00:02:55,954
No, no. I saw him.

66
00:02:55,979 --> 00:02:57,595
He... he didn't bump into me.

67
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,004
He put himself where you could see him.

68
00:02:59,029 --> 00:03:00,262
I'm calling Mikhail right now.

69
00:03:00,296 --> 00:03:01,664
- He won't answer.
- What?

70
00:03:01,698 --> 00:03:02,996
But you know that.

71
00:03:03,021 --> 00:03:04,822
Alex, what are you talking about?

72
00:03:04,847 --> 00:03:07,012
He's dead. He was executed.

73
00:03:07,037 --> 00:03:08,203
What?

74
00:03:08,238 --> 00:03:10,272
The SVR discovered he was a traitor.

75
00:03:10,306 --> 00:03:11,273
Who?

76
00:03:11,307 --> 00:03:13,137
The Sluzhba Vneshney Razvedki.

77
00:03:13,162 --> 00:03:14,986
The Russian foreign intelligence service.

78
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:17,312
The KGB rebranded itself after
the Soviet union broke up,

79
00:03:17,347 --> 00:03:20,336
but she knows that
since she works for them.

80
00:03:21,057 --> 00:03:23,925
What is wrong with you?

81
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,797
What the...

82
00:03:25,822 --> 00:03:26,855
Is wrong with you?

83
00:03:26,871 --> 00:03:28,722
_

84
00:03:28,758 --> 00:03:32,061
- _
-  You accuse me of spying for the Russians?

85
00:03:32,095 --> 00:03:35,154
Because one time I called
my old friend by his name?

86
00:03:35,179 --> 00:03:37,180
- Because...
- August 18, 1994.

87
00:03:37,205 --> 00:03:38,476
You snuck out of the house at midnight,

88
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:39,758
didn't come back till 5:00 A.M.

89
00:03:39,783 --> 00:03:41,756
Your mother was working in
the ER back then on call.

90
00:03:41,781 --> 00:03:43,103
I know.

91
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,840
You told me that's where
you were when you came home

92
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,650
and found me waiting at
the top of the stairs.

93
00:03:46,675 --> 00:03:47,975
But Kings County Medical
Center was evacuated

94
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,534
on August 18, 1994.

95
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:51,620
Tropical storm Beryl
flooded the bottom two floors

96
00:03:51,645 --> 00:03:52,715
and blew out all the power.

97
00:03:52,749 --> 00:03:54,216
You lied to me.

98
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:55,718
Alex, I know that I wasn't around enough

99
00:03:55,752 --> 00:03:57,253
when you were young and struggling.

100
00:03:57,287 --> 00:03:59,221
- I know that.
- June '96, dad was in Beijing.

101
00:03:59,256 --> 00:04:00,589
You left me with Natalie to go

102
00:04:00,624 --> 00:04:02,291
to a pediatric oncology
conference in Boston.

103
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,859
The conference never happened.

104
00:04:03,894 --> 00:04:05,261
It didn't exist. I can keep going.

105
00:04:05,295 --> 00:04:07,196
- Stop.
- Then stop lying to me!

106
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,531
Alex, you don't want to know the truth

107
00:04:08,565 --> 00:04:10,232
about where I went all those nights.

108
00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:12,435
Tell me the truth, or tell the FBI.

109
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:15,604
Your choice.

110
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:17,473
Okay.

111
00:04:18,436 --> 00:04:20,611
_

112
00:04:26,717 --> 00:04:31,320
I was having an affair.

113
00:04:34,468 --> 00:04:36,049
_

114
00:04:36,074 --> 00:04:37,471
_

115
00:04:37,496 --> 00:04:38,995
_

116
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,199
Mark, I'm so sorry.

117
00:04:43,233 --> 00:04:45,501
Please tell me that's not true.

118
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:49,005
You were overseas for
months at a time and...

119
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,740
making a living for us.

120
00:04:50,774 --> 00:04:53,242
- I was... I was so lonely.
- Lonely?

121
00:04:53,277 --> 00:04:54,710
I was lonely too.

122
00:04:54,745 --> 00:04:55,878
I...

123
00:04:58,782 --> 00:05:00,516
I'm so ashamed.

124
00:05:03,687 --> 00:05:07,423
You wanted the truth, so now you have it.

125
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:12,228
Dad, uh...

126
00:05:12,272 --> 00:05:13,839
I'm sorry. I...

127
00:05:13,864 --> 00:05:16,499
Alex, please.

128
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:19,535
I think you should go.

129
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,963
Your mom and I need to talk.

130
00:05:32,983 --> 00:05:37,954
Your mother is very good.

134

Cheap energy, Wall Street
gambling, and propaganda

135
00:05:59,309 --> 00:06:01,410
are the only things propping it up.

136
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:06,315
This operation will answer the
American aggression forcefully.

137
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,651
Collapsing their economy in a single blow.

138
00:06:08,685 --> 00:06:10,987
American influence over
the world will erode,

139
00:06:11,021 --> 00:06:13,723
and we will be able to operate as we wish

140
00:06:13,757 --> 00:06:17,760
in the Ukraine, in Europe, and beyond.

141
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,296
We are calling it "Black Dagger".

142
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,998
Madness.

143
00:06:22,032 --> 00:06:24,433
This plan will kill thousands of Americans.

144
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:25,935
Tens of thousands.

145
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:30,139
Madness is the last of Russian sovereignty.

146
00:06:30,173 --> 00:06:33,142
Madness is American sanctions forbidding us

147
00:06:33,176 --> 00:06:34,844
from accessing our own bank account.

148
00:06:34,878 --> 00:06:37,780
Now even in Switzerland.

149
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:39,530
This is madness.

150
00:06:39,993 --> 00:06:44,191
_

151
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,859
_

152
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:49,692
There is a line, Mr. Bok.

153
00:06:49,717 --> 00:06:52,152
Black Dagger crosses it.

154
00:06:52,195 --> 00:06:55,932
We're merely answering
sanctions with sanctions.

155
00:06:55,966 --> 00:06:59,068
American sanctions don't
have a blast radius.

156
00:07:03,091 --> 00:07:05,290
_

157
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,031

158

_

160
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,040
You don't have to destroy the house.

161
00:07:38,075 --> 00:07:40,543
I want them gone.

162
00:07:51,521 --> 00:07:54,690
I should have come to you first.

163
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:57,360
Everything's going to be all right.

164
00:07:57,394 --> 00:08:02,064
Alex knew I was lying about all
those nights that I wasn't here.

165
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:04,166
I reached for the only explanation

166
00:08:04,201 --> 00:08:05,167
that he wouldn't have considered.

167
00:08:05,202 --> 00:08:07,170
And it worked.

168
00:08:07,204 --> 00:08:08,204
You know what would have happened

169
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:09,939
if you couldn't convince him?

170
00:08:09,973 --> 00:08:13,342
The SVR would have killed us.

171
00:08:13,377 --> 00:08:16,012
I'm afraid he'll never forgive me.

172
00:08:16,046 --> 00:08:17,280
He will.

173
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:24,520
You are his mother.

174
00:08:24,554 --> 00:08:26,589
He'll get past it.

175
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:32,261
You're late for work.

176
00:08:32,296 --> 00:08:34,297
Go.

177
00:08:42,906 --> 00:08:44,640
I'm sorry.

178
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:47,843
I'll see you tonight.

179
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:55,551
Using our K-31 ramjet,
with the doped fuel mixture,

180
00:08:55,586 --> 00:08:59,989
we can produce a block V
that would fly at Mach 4.75.

181
00:09:00,023 --> 00:09:02,792
Same range and payload as the block IVS

182
00:09:02,826 --> 00:09:05,595
the Navy's currently using
but with six times the speed.

183
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:07,296
It's a no-brainer.

184
00:09:15,706 --> 00:09:18,474
Alex, how long have I been following you?

185
00:09:18,508 --> 00:09:19,809
- What?
- Three blocks.

186
00:09:19,843 --> 00:09:21,811
You looked straight ahead the whole time.

187
00:09:21,845 --> 00:09:25,948
I was walking forward.

188
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:27,650
Am I in trouble?

189
00:09:27,684 --> 00:09:29,919
I don't know... is there
something you're not telling me?

190
00:09:29,953 --> 00:09:31,287
No.

191
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:34,490
Good. Then stop blabbing and walk with me.

192
00:09:34,524 --> 00:09:36,158
Irina's murder convinced Washington

193
00:09:36,193 --> 00:09:39,262
that the SVR really is
planning attack on U.S. soil.

194
00:09:39,296 --> 00:09:42,298
DC is setting up a joint
task force to stop it.

195
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,767
You're being detailed to it.

196
00:09:44,801 --> 00:09:47,309
Really? And you?

197
00:09:47,334 --> 00:09:48,935
Look, I'm just saying, Jeter really was

198
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,362
the heart and soul of the team, man.

199
00:09:51,575 --> 00:09:53,643
Can't talk shop when a
stranger's passing nearby.

200
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:56,112
I'll have a kind of observer status.

201
00:09:56,146 --> 00:09:59,148
Can't run a New York station
if I'm assigned to a task force.

202
00:10:02,586 --> 00:10:04,520
Since this is a domestic investigation,

203
00:10:04,554 --> 00:10:06,822
the Bureau will have
final say on what you do.

204
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:10,726
But don't forget, you
still work for me too.

205
00:10:10,761 --> 00:10:12,361
We're in here.

206
00:10:12,396 --> 00:10:13,963
This is not a government building.

207
00:10:13,997 --> 00:10:15,331
Oh, it's not.

208
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:17,767
This is a covert task force, bill.

209
00:10:24,274 --> 00:10:27,343
- Hey, Jeff.
- Sir.

210
00:10:40,524 --> 00:10:42,525
Gentlemen.

211
00:10:49,466 --> 00:10:51,067
Phone.

212
00:10:53,971 --> 00:10:56,272
Come on.

213
00:11:03,647 --> 00:11:05,414
Sam, good to see you again.

214
00:11:05,449 --> 00:11:06,515
Michelle, keeping out of trouble?

215
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,551
Mm, courting it.

216
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,386
Ah, this is Alex O'Connor,

217
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,588
but out in the world, he's
in alias as Bill Adams.

218
00:11:12,623 --> 00:11:14,790
Isn't that right, Bill?

219
00:11:14,825 --> 00:11:16,759
- Michelle Prado.
- Alex O'Connor.

220
00:11:16,793 --> 00:11:18,094
Uh, Adams. Damn it.

221
00:11:21,164 --> 00:11:24,166
Let me introduce you
to Special Agent Brock.

222
00:11:29,006 --> 00:11:30,640
Whatever this plot is,
it appears bad enough

223
00:11:30,674 --> 00:11:34,944
to convince two SVR
lifers to try and defect.

224
00:11:34,978 --> 00:11:36,212
Bob?

225
00:11:39,182 --> 00:11:41,250
The best plan we have to stop it

226
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:43,486
is to find the SVR files Mikhail stole.

227
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,756
His, uh, Easter egg, as it's been called.

228
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,457
It means digging deep into Mikhail's life,

229
00:11:48,492 --> 00:11:50,326
which we've already begun.

230
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,062
As of 20 minutes ago, we
found Mikhail's apartment,

231
00:11:53,096 --> 00:11:54,997
rented under an alias, Carroll Gardens.

232
00:11:55,032 --> 00:11:56,666
We're moving on it now.

233
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,901
It's guaranteed the SVR has
already scrubbed the place.

234
00:11:58,936 --> 00:12:00,136
And?

235
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,437
Let's put a surveillance team on it,

236
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:02,972
see if the Russians send in a second wave.

237
00:12:03,006 --> 00:12:04,607
We're not here to sit on our asses, Sam.

238
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,676
SVR is planning an attack against us.

239
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:09,312
I know, William. CIA
supplied the intelligence.

240
00:12:09,346 --> 00:12:11,614
And FBI will assume that
attack is happening today,

241
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:14,684
every day until we stop it.

242
00:12:14,718 --> 00:12:16,519
So we move now.

243
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,155
Walk with me.

244
00:12:54,158 --> 00:12:56,792
You were right.

245
00:12:56,827 --> 00:12:58,294
About what?

246
00:12:58,328 --> 00:13:00,363
Alex O'Connor.

247
00:13:00,397 --> 00:13:03,132
We could never have recruited him.

248
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,534
Yesterday he was ready
to turn his own parents in

249
00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:08,137
for being spies.

250
00:13:08,171 --> 00:13:10,206
I actually ordered Akos
to kill the whole family

251
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,808
to protect our operations.

252
00:13:12,843 --> 00:13:17,179
Of course, you countermanded that.

253
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:19,248
Only because the threat was gone.

254
00:13:19,283 --> 00:13:21,517
Katya turned things around.

255
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:23,753
For now.

256
00:13:23,787 --> 00:13:26,722
I didn't want to lose Alex as a source.

257
00:13:26,757 --> 00:13:30,359
Still, you took it upon yourself
to determine our priorities.

258
00:13:37,701 --> 00:13:38,668
I'm sorry.

259
00:13:38,702 --> 00:13:41,337
Don't apologize to me.

260
00:13:41,371 --> 00:13:43,414
Apologize to Akos.

261
00:13:58,388 --> 00:14:00,523
He disobeyed a direct order.

262
00:14:00,557 --> 00:14:01,958
You overstepped your authority.

263
00:14:01,992 --> 00:14:02,959
There's a difference.

264
00:14:02,993 --> 00:14:04,360
There's...

265
00:14:04,394 --> 00:14:07,296
A small difference.

266
00:14:07,331 --> 00:14:09,738
_

267
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,873
_

268
00:14:11,998 --> 00:14:13,498
_

269
00:14:17,841 --> 00:14:20,376
As you know, the FBI just
detailed Alex O'Connor

270
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:23,546
to a task force set up
to find Mikhail's files.

271
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,148
And the bug in Alex's phone cannot transmit

272
00:14:26,183 --> 00:14:28,918
from inside their offices.

273
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:31,454
We cannot let them get to
those files before we do.

274
00:14:31,488 --> 00:14:34,590
We need to track their investigation.

275
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:37,827
We need audio in their offices.

276
00:14:37,861 --> 00:14:41,397
Inside the office will be very challenging.

277
00:14:41,431 --> 00:14:44,433
Should I tell Moscow you're
unable to rise to the challenge?

278
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:49,906
Perhaps I can get a micro recorder

279
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,908
onto Alex O'Connor.

280
00:14:51,942 --> 00:14:54,143
Something that can record
while he's inside the office

281
00:14:54,177 --> 00:14:57,680
and burst transmit to us when
he's outside the building.

282
00:14:57,714 --> 00:14:59,682
Good idea.

283
00:14:59,716 --> 00:15:01,984
Report back to me when it's done.

284
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:12,828
Completely scrubbed.

285
00:15:12,863 --> 00:15:14,363
Nothing at all?

286
00:15:14,398 --> 00:15:16,599
A few stray hairs, a few
shards of what I think

287
00:15:16,633 --> 00:15:20,002
is fiberglass from the
hallway, not much else.

288
00:15:30,547 --> 00:15:31,714
Where did you find him?

289
00:15:31,748 --> 00:15:33,382
NCS Director.

290
00:15:33,417 --> 00:15:35,151
In her infinite wisdom.

291
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:37,320
You should watch him
debrief a defector someday.

292
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:39,188
I heard about what he did.

293
00:15:39,222 --> 00:15:41,557
He's how we found what's
left of Mikhail's body.

294
00:15:41,592 --> 00:15:44,126
And the whole Easter egg theory is his.

295
00:15:44,161 --> 00:15:48,564
But he's going to need
some coaching in the field.

296
00:15:48,599 --> 00:15:51,801
I can coach.

297
00:15:51,835 --> 00:15:54,237
What?

298
00:15:54,271 --> 00:15:56,472
I thought you liked girls.

299
00:15:56,507 --> 00:15:59,475
Oh, Sam, you have such
a constrained view of me.

300
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:01,677
Yeah, you really should
have joined the Agency.

301
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:05,181
How do you survive at a
place as stodgy as the FBI?

302
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,560
What about him?

303
00:16:17,594 --> 00:16:19,862
He's turned away two fares.

304
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:21,764
Could be having his lunch.

305
00:16:21,798 --> 00:16:23,933
I don't see him eating.

306
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:30,282
No fare. No fare.

307
00:16:30,307 --> 00:16:31,273
I don't want a ride.

308
00:16:31,308 --> 00:16:33,396
_

309
00:17:59,237 --> 00:18:01,171
He's gotta be SVR.

310
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:03,607
Why would SVR have an officer outside

311
00:18:03,641 --> 00:18:06,376
waiting on the inevitable wave
of federal agents to descend?

312
00:18:06,411 --> 00:18:07,323
It's too risky.

313
00:18:07,345 --> 00:18:08,846
The cab was stolen.

314
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,214
Another risky choice.

315
00:18:10,248 --> 00:18:12,149
He kept his face down the entire run.

316
00:18:12,184 --> 00:18:14,819
Not a single usable image
for facial recognition.

317
00:18:14,853 --> 00:18:16,487
The cab was clean.

318
00:18:16,521 --> 00:18:18,389
Basically we know nothing about this guy.

319
00:18:18,423 --> 00:18:20,357
He had sticky fingers.

320
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:22,893
What?

321
00:18:22,928 --> 00:18:25,062
There was a discoloration in the pattern

322
00:18:25,097 --> 00:18:26,530
on the fingers of his right hand.

323
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:28,833
I think it was from being wrapped in tape.

324
00:18:28,867 --> 00:18:30,334
A boxer.

325
00:18:30,368 --> 00:18:31,836
The guy could fight.

326
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:34,939
Michelle, get a list of local boxing gyms.

327
00:18:34,973 --> 00:18:35,940
A boxer?

328
00:18:35,974 --> 00:18:39,410
Well, that's a start.

329
00:18:39,444 --> 00:18:41,379
Why don't you go back to
your hotel and clean up?

330
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:43,581
I don't have any more clean shirts left.

331
00:18:43,615 --> 00:18:44,949
I only packed for three days.

332
00:18:44,983 --> 00:18:46,217
We're in Manhattan.

333
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:48,252
It is possible to buy more here.

334
00:18:51,723 --> 00:18:54,558
So why did you call me, not mom?

335
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:56,460
Mom doesn't pick out my shirts.

336
00:18:56,495 --> 00:18:58,562
Not anymore.

337
00:18:58,597 --> 00:19:01,508
You mean as of tonight
when I'm doing it instead?

338
00:19:01,533 --> 00:19:03,500
I don't have great taste. So what?

339
00:19:05,804 --> 00:19:10,007
I'm just giving you a hard time.

340
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,175
I knew that.

341
00:19:11,209 --> 00:19:12,309
No, you didn't.

342
00:19:12,344 --> 00:19:15,346
But that's okay.

343
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:19,884
How about this one?

344
00:19:21,353 --> 00:19:23,420
Pink? Are... are you kidding me?

345
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:25,656
Pink's back.

346
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:27,625
Blue... is blue back too?

347
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:30,294
Blue never went away, but, um,

348
00:19:30,328 --> 00:19:33,664
frankly it's about the cut, not the color.

349
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:40,871
So you were going to tell me?

350
00:19:40,905 --> 00:19:42,973
Tell you what?

351
00:19:43,008 --> 00:19:46,543
What's up with you and mom?

352
00:19:46,578 --> 00:19:48,512
It's hard to explain.

353
00:19:48,546 --> 00:19:51,982
Then don't explain it,
just tell me what it is.

354
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:56,820
When we were kids, do you
remember how much mom was gone?

355
00:19:59,524 --> 00:20:01,124
I remember when she was there

356
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:04,351
'cause most of the time she wasn't.

357
00:20:04,376 --> 00:20:08,612
Sometimes even in the middle of the night.

358
00:20:08,637 --> 00:20:11,272
A lot of times.

359
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:16,001
Dad told me what happened.

360
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,751
I can't believe what I did.

361
00:20:18,855 --> 00:20:20,623
What's going to happen to mom and dad now?

362
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:24,117
You didn't do anything.

363
00:20:24,142 --> 00:20:27,310
I hate to say it, but...

364
00:20:27,335 --> 00:20:29,336
But what?

365
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:33,731
Alex, everybody knew
she was having an affair.

366
00:20:33,992 --> 00:20:36,326
- Dad didn't know.
- Dad didn't want to know then.

367
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:37,361
Well, I didn't know.

368
00:20:37,395 --> 00:20:39,029
You were a kid.

369
00:20:39,063 --> 00:20:42,165
Mom made mistakes. Now
she has to pay for them.

370
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,889
That's the way life is.

371
00:20:44,914 --> 00:20:49,018
Look, Alex, what's between
mom and dad is their business.

372
00:20:49,043 --> 00:20:52,946
If I were you, I would just leave it alone.

373
00:21:00,018 --> 00:21:02,786
She had to play it that way, Katya.

374
00:21:02,821 --> 00:21:04,988
She didn't have to enjoy it.

375
00:21:06,591 --> 00:21:11,929
♪ No, I never heard them at all ♪

376
00:21:11,963 --> 00:21:17,901
♪ Till there was you ♪

377
00:21:19,204 --> 00:21:21,138

378
00:21:21,172 --> 00:21:23,273

379
00:21:23,308 --> 00:21:26,977
♪ In the sky ♪

380
00:21:27,011 --> 00:21:27,978
♪ But I never ♪

381
00:21:28,012 --> 00:21:30,314
I don't think so.

382
00:21:30,348 --> 00:21:34,251
Just for a few minutes.

383
00:21:34,285 --> 00:21:39,122
Are we really going to do this again?

384
00:21:39,157 --> 00:21:42,993
It didn't work out so well last time.

385
00:21:43,027 --> 00:21:45,529
Now it...

386
00:21:45,563 --> 00:21:47,264
it isn't even safe.

387
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,036
Was it ever?

388
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,937
It's worse now.

389
00:21:53,972 --> 00:21:56,340
Believe me.

390
00:21:58,209 --> 00:22:00,844
♪ They tell me ♪

391
00:22:00,879 --> 00:22:04,415
Do you ever think about me?

392
00:22:07,418 --> 00:22:09,119
It's not enough to make it make sense.

393
00:22:12,724 --> 00:22:14,458
When my mother came to me the other day

394
00:22:14,492 --> 00:22:17,895
about the family leaving,

395
00:22:17,929 --> 00:22:21,365
I said she was crazy.

396
00:22:21,399 --> 00:22:24,368
I had a life here, a job,

397
00:22:24,402 --> 00:22:27,905
friends, an apartment.

398
00:22:27,939 --> 00:22:30,874
I told her I couldn't leave it all.

399
00:22:33,845 --> 00:22:36,046
I was talking about you.

400
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:49,726
- Yes?
- Telecom research.

401
00:22:49,761 --> 00:22:51,762
Right, I need a primer on fiber optics.

402
00:22:51,796 --> 00:22:52,763
We can do that.

403
00:22:52,797 --> 00:22:54,865
Can you hang on a second?

404
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:55,890
_

405
00:23:03,908 --> 00:23:05,743
Uh, I'm back.

406
00:23:05,777 --> 00:23:07,511
This is Alex O'Connor.
Please leave a message.

407
00:23:10,482 --> 00:23:15,018
Hi, Alex. It's mom.

408
00:23:15,053 --> 00:23:17,054
Call me.

409
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:46,524
You're making it harder, Katya.

410
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:49,026
It's my home.

411
00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:50,461
Think what you did will stop the rezident

412
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:51,963
from bugging it again?

413
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:53,631
If I find a strange man in my house,

414
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:57,468
he may end up with a bull in his head.

415
00:23:57,502 --> 00:24:01,405
My home is off-limits.

416
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,074
Alex's new offices are completely

417
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,475
walled off electronically.

418
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,544
We need to get a micro recorder inside.

419
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:08,679
Good luck.

420
00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:12,216
Duplicates of the shirts
Alex bought tonight.

421
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:14,685
One button on each is a recorder
with a burst transmitter.

422
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,088
It will upload the audio
when a signal is available.

423
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,991
I need you to switch the shirts tonight.

424
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:22,059
Alex isn't even talking to me.

425
00:24:22,094 --> 00:24:24,395
You'll figure something out.

426
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:27,865
Yesterday proved you haven't lost a step.

427
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,534
An affair?

428
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:32,418
_

429
00:24:34,538 --> 00:24:39,647
_

430
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:43,614
I mean it.

431
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:47,718
You are an exceptionally gifted spy, Katya.

432
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:50,054
Accept who you are.

433
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:51,989
Everything will go better for both of us.

434
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,865
So we just need to figure out

435
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:03,734
how to get into Alex's hotel room.

436
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:10,341
Are you with me right now?

437
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:15,613
I heard you.

438
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:16,948
What's wrong?

439
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:22,286
When Alex was 12,

440
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:26,224
he was suppose to memorize the
Gettysburg address for school.

441
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:28,559
Instead he memorized every single speech

442
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:31,495
Lincoln ever gave.

443
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,797
In a week, just in case.

444
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:34,632
He remembers everything.

445
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:38,669
Everything from his whole life.

446
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,471
And?

447
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:42,740
That night Alex mentioned

448
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:44,809
when you said you were at the hospital,

449
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:47,645
but it was actually flooded,

450
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,148
do you remember where you really were?

451
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:55,019
No idea. Why?

452
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,121
I was just thinking about it earlier today.

453
00:25:57,155 --> 00:26:00,424
That night. The night of the storm.

454
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:03,528
I was in Saudi Arabia
negotiating a radar sale.

455
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,329
CNN reported on it, on the storm.

456
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:06,764
It was bad. I was worried.

457
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:08,599
I called several times. You didn't pick up.

458
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:11,302
Yeah, I made up the affair story, Mark.

459
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:13,137
Okay?

460
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:17,174
And not just to save
myself but to save you.

461
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:19,310
And Alex hates me because of it.

462
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:20,478
And now you're gonna turn on me?

463
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:21,979
I just asked a question, Katya.

464
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:25,316
Well, we don't have time for questions.

465
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,851
Here's what I remember.

466
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:28,553
I remember the deal
that we made with Victor,

467
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,188
the deal that you forced me to make,

468
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:32,957
saying we had access to
Alex's car, his phone,

469
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:34,292
- his computer...
- We had no other option.

470
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:35,860
You could have let me turn myself in.

471
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:37,128
And destroy our family?

472
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:40,163
That's not a choice you get to make.

473
00:26:45,571 --> 00:26:47,972
We get what the SVR needs,

474
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:51,075
or they go after Alex directly.

475
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:59,650
What words do you need me to say, Mark?

476
00:26:59,685 --> 00:27:03,154
That I didn't cheat on you?

477
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:06,090
I didn't.

478
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,259
I didn't have an affair.

479
00:27:12,598 --> 00:27:16,534
The affair was so long ago, I
almost forgot that it happened.

480
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:19,503
How do you forget something like that?

481
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:23,374
If you don't want to remember.

482
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:25,676
- This doesn't...
- It... it was a mistake.

483
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:29,680
It just doesn't seem like you.

484
00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:30,781
It is me.

485
00:27:33,552 --> 00:27:36,554
Your father was traveling so much then.

486
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,478
I felt neglected.

487
00:27:38,643 --> 00:27:41,078
But that's... it's not a excuse.

488
00:27:41,103 --> 00:27:44,138
There is no excuse.

489
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:47,365
And the worst thing about
it is that it took time

490
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:49,967
away from you and Natalie.

491
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:51,202
I hurt you then,

492
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:56,707
and to be doing that again now,

493
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:58,576
I feel horrible.

494
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:09,187
Alex...

495
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:11,689
Do you remember when you were young

496
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:14,459
how much you loved the Carnegie Deli?

497
00:28:14,493 --> 00:28:17,195
It's right around the corner.

498
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:19,297
Mom, I can't. I have to work.

499
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:21,499
You have to eat.

500
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:26,604
Okay.

501
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:39,050
I'm not the mother I wanted to be, Alex.

502
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:42,086
I'm sorry.

503
00:28:42,121 --> 00:28:44,355
I love you, mama.

504
00:29:07,725 --> 00:29:09,759
We went through every frame of footage

505
00:29:09,784 --> 00:29:11,637
from every surveillance
camera in the area again.

506
00:29:11,662 --> 00:29:13,830
Nothing, no prints on
the cab, inside or out.

507
00:29:13,864 --> 00:29:16,399
Great... a dozen of the top
counterintelligence agents

508
00:29:16,433 --> 00:29:18,165
in the Bureau, blank check for a budget,

509
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,403
the entire U.S. Intelligence
Community on tap,

510
00:29:20,437 --> 00:29:23,005
and we're reduced to sweeping
local gyms for Russian boxers.

511
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,407
We should stop doing that.

512
00:29:24,441 --> 00:29:25,942
Our cabbie's not a boxer.

513
00:29:25,976 --> 00:29:27,477
The tape residue was
only on his right hand,

514
00:29:27,511 --> 00:29:28,611
and I think our guy's left-handed.

515
00:29:28,645 --> 00:29:29,979
Based on what?

516
00:29:30,013 --> 00:29:31,748
During the foot chase,
he went left four times

517
00:29:31,782 --> 00:29:33,483
are right twice before we lost him.

518
00:29:33,517 --> 00:29:34,984
A review of the video
cameras that caught him

519
00:29:35,018 --> 00:29:36,285
before he disappeared into the subway

520
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,754
showed three more lefts and no rights.

521
00:29:37,788 --> 00:29:39,522
He went left seven times and right twice.

522
00:29:39,556 --> 00:29:41,190
And that means he's left-handed?

523
00:29:41,225 --> 00:29:42,759
More than likely, yes,
according to the literature

524
00:29:42,793 --> 00:29:43,760
on unconscious biases,

525
00:29:43,794 --> 00:29:44,961
and that got me thinking.

526
00:29:44,995 --> 00:29:46,462
I mean, I couldn't stop thinking

527
00:29:46,497 --> 00:29:48,097
about the fiberglass shards
we found in the hallway

528
00:29:48,132 --> 00:29:50,166
outside Mikhail's apartment...
they were high quality.

529
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,768
Something called
siprnet-grade fiber optics

530
00:29:51,802 --> 00:29:53,390
according to our techs.

531
00:29:53,415 --> 00:29:56,025
Last night I spoke to a CIA
S&T expert about fiber optics.

532
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:58,484
Turns out fiber optics
engineers wear double-sided tape

533
00:29:58,509 --> 00:29:59,976
on their non dominant
hand to protect themselves

534
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:02,011
from fiberglass shards
embedding in the skin.

535
00:30:02,046 --> 00:30:03,713
And then there are his
glasses. They're unusual.

536
00:30:03,747 --> 00:30:05,648
The lenses have an optical density of 4+

537
00:30:05,683 --> 00:30:07,116
in the 850 to 1,700 nanometer range.

538
00:30:07,151 --> 00:30:10,319
Take a breath, Alex.

539
00:30:10,354 --> 00:30:13,189
Uh, right.

540
00:30:13,223 --> 00:30:16,492
850 to 1,700 nanometers is
the most common wavelengths

541
00:30:16,527 --> 00:30:18,795
encountered in fiber optics applications.

542
00:30:18,829 --> 00:30:20,229
Are you talking about his work?

543
00:30:20,264 --> 00:30:22,365
Yes.

544
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:25,368
He lays fiber optic cable for a living.

545
00:30:25,402 --> 00:30:27,203
And given the particular
grade of his equipment,

546
00:30:27,237 --> 00:30:29,072
I say he does so for a
data management company

547
00:30:29,106 --> 00:30:30,506
or a high-end security firm.

548
00:30:30,541 --> 00:30:32,208
There have to be dozens
of firms that do that

549
00:30:32,242 --> 00:30:33,209
in the tri-state area.

550
00:30:33,243 --> 00:30:34,477
52.

551
00:30:34,511 --> 00:30:36,679
How many of them have Russian employees?

552
00:30:36,714 --> 00:30:38,047
I don't know.

553
00:30:38,082 --> 00:30:39,849
But the cabbie's accent was Georgian,

554
00:30:39,883 --> 00:30:41,384
and only one of those firms
employees a Georgian national.

555
00:30:41,418 --> 00:30:43,486
His name is Vasso Matiashvili.

556
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,588
All that from one all-nighter?

557
00:30:45,623 --> 00:30:47,356
No, I slept.

558
00:30:47,391 --> 00:30:48,992
The firm says he works from a home office,

559
00:30:49,026 --> 00:30:51,227
but they wouldn't give me an address.

560
00:30:51,261 --> 00:30:52,261
We're gonna need a warrant.

561
00:30:52,296 --> 00:30:53,396
No way a cyber-security firm

562
00:30:53,437 --> 00:30:54,671
opens up their personnel files

563
00:30:54,698 --> 00:30:55,943
out of the goodness of their heart.

564
00:30:55,968 --> 00:30:58,803
I'll walk it into the
U.S. Attorney's office.

565
00:30:58,828 --> 00:31:01,129
You go with her.

566
00:31:10,714 --> 00:31:12,782
Do I have food in my teeth or something?

567
00:31:12,816 --> 00:31:15,385
No. Uh, no.

568
00:31:23,961 --> 00:31:28,078
_

569
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:39,409
You okay?

570
00:31:39,443 --> 00:31:40,610
Yeah.

571
00:31:40,644 --> 00:31:42,745
You're protecting him, dad.

572
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:45,048
The truth would destroy him.

573
00:31:45,082 --> 00:31:48,718
Well, the lies might destroy me.

574
00:31:48,752 --> 00:31:52,055
They don't come naturally to you

575
00:31:52,089 --> 00:31:54,891
like they do to mom.

576
00:31:54,925 --> 00:31:56,159
What's that supposed to mean?

577
00:31:56,193 --> 00:31:58,728
Forget it.

578
00:31:58,762 --> 00:32:01,564
You think she had an affair?

579
00:32:01,598 --> 00:32:03,399
I don't know.

580
00:32:03,434 --> 00:32:04,901
It's none of my business.

581
00:32:04,935 --> 00:32:07,804
No, it's not.

582
00:32:20,184 --> 00:32:22,318
Are you uncomfortable?

583
00:32:22,353 --> 00:32:25,588
I don't like vinyl surfaces.

584
00:32:25,623 --> 00:32:26,589
No one does, really.

585
00:32:26,623 --> 00:32:27,924
According to his file,

586
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:29,992
Mikhail was in internal
counterintelligence.

587
00:32:30,027 --> 00:32:31,928
He didn't have any computer skills really

588
00:32:31,962 --> 00:32:34,063
at all.

589
00:32:34,965 --> 00:32:37,533
That was in his file?

590
00:32:39,903 --> 00:32:41,671
I really don't like these seats.

591
00:32:41,705 --> 00:32:42,866
It's a government car.

592
00:32:42,891 --> 00:32:44,325
You're not supposed to
like anything about it.

593
00:32:44,808 --> 00:32:45,775
And I think it's leather, actually.

594
00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:46,776
No, it's vinyl.

595
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:49,212
And it wasn't in his file.

596
00:32:49,246 --> 00:32:50,513
But you don't need computer skills

597
00:32:50,547 --> 00:32:51,714
to be in counterintelligence.

598
00:32:51,749 --> 00:32:54,017
You need to have a nose for defectors.

599
00:32:54,051 --> 00:32:55,051
Okay, what does that mean?

600
00:32:56,086 --> 00:32:59,989
I don't know yet.

601
00:33:00,024 --> 00:33:03,726
He lays fiber optic cable for a living.

602
00:33:05,029 --> 00:33:08,831
Any idea who he's talking about?

603
00:33:08,866 --> 00:33:11,300
Vasso Matiashvili.

604
00:33:11,335 --> 00:33:13,903
We recruited him from a
Georgian paramilitary unit

605
00:33:13,937 --> 00:33:15,038
ten years ago.

606
00:33:15,072 --> 00:33:16,406
Came to America on a work VISA,

607
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,207
we placed him in corporate security.

608
00:33:18,242 --> 00:33:20,410
What was he doing hovering
around Mikhail's apartment

609
00:33:20,444 --> 00:33:22,311
pretending to be a cab driver?

610
00:33:22,346 --> 00:33:25,081
I plan to ask him that.

611
00:33:25,115 --> 00:33:28,739
_

612
00:33:28,764 --> 00:33:30,396
_

613
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:35,625
We've been here for four
hours. How much longer?

614
00:33:38,629 --> 00:33:39,929
Really?

615
00:33:39,963 --> 00:33:41,698
Fine.

616
00:33:41,732 --> 00:33:45,635
It's just a warrant. What
takes these judges so long?

617
00:33:57,448 --> 00:33:58,748
Hello?

618
00:33:58,782 --> 00:34:00,049
Getting that warrant

619
00:34:00,084 --> 00:34:02,418
isn't going to help you find me.

620
00:34:02,453 --> 00:34:05,788
If you want to talk, do as I say.

621
00:34:05,823 --> 00:34:07,724
Vasso?

622
00:34:07,758 --> 00:34:11,094
Toss the batteries from your
cell phones out the window.

623
00:34:11,128 --> 00:34:13,630
I'm tracking the MSID pings.

624
00:34:13,664 --> 00:34:16,232
I'll know if you've complied.

625
00:34:16,266 --> 00:34:17,800
And if we don't?

626
00:34:17,835 --> 00:34:19,130
I hang up,

627
00:34:19,155 --> 00:34:21,323
and you'll never know
what I know about Mikhail.

628
00:34:31,515 --> 00:34:33,049
So let's talk.

629
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:35,485
Drive across the Williamsburg Bridge.

630
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:39,389
Park on 11th.

631
00:34:39,423 --> 00:34:40,890
We could be driving into a trap.

632
00:34:40,924 --> 00:34:42,458
If he wanted us dead, he'd have put

633
00:34:42,493 --> 00:34:45,161
a bomb in the car, not a cell phone.

634
00:34:45,205 --> 00:34:48,574
I don't think he wants
to kill us or anyone.

635
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:50,500
So what does he want then?

636
00:34:50,541 --> 00:34:52,676
I think he wants to defect.

637
00:34:52,703 --> 00:34:55,685
_

638
00:34:58,642 --> 00:35:00,310
He's with two federal agents.
How are they going to grab him?

639
00:35:00,344 --> 00:35:01,344
Carefully.

640
00:35:01,629 --> 00:35:03,813
_

641
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:04,923
_

642
00:35:04,948 --> 00:35:06,983
Use force against U.S. federal agents

643
00:35:07,017 --> 00:35:08,418
in their own country?

644
00:35:08,452 --> 00:35:10,086
This is a line Moscow has never crossed.

645
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,254
I don't think you understand
the stakes, Victor.

646
00:35:11,288 --> 00:35:12,522
I do.

647
00:35:12,556 --> 00:35:15,358
If it goes wrong, if they end up dead,

648
00:35:15,392 --> 00:35:17,026
that's the kind of thing that
could restart the cold war.

649
00:35:17,061 --> 00:35:19,829
If the Americans get their
hands on the files Mikhail stole,

650
00:35:19,863 --> 00:35:22,765
it will start an actual war.

651
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,334
We need Vasso.

652
00:35:24,368 --> 00:35:26,268
At any cost.

653
00:35:36,536 --> 00:35:38,170
Where are they?

654
00:35:38,205 --> 00:35:40,506
11th Street in Brooklyn,
but that's just a first stop.

655
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:41,917
Where after that?

656
00:35:41,942 --> 00:35:43,075
I don't know,

657
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:47,046
but it feels like a trap.

658
00:35:50,183 --> 00:35:51,250
We're in Brooklyn.

659
00:35:51,285 --> 00:35:52,603
Yes, I know.

660
00:35:52,628 --> 00:35:54,708
Southwest Corner of the
Old Brooklyn Navy Yard.

661
00:35:54,733 --> 00:35:57,232
Bond Street's the fastest
way to the Navy Yard.

662
00:35:57,257 --> 00:35:58,524
No, there's construction at Livingston.

663
00:35:58,558 --> 00:36:00,726
We'll get stuck.

664
00:36:05,245 --> 00:36:07,253
_

665
00:36:24,585 --> 00:36:26,285
You ready for this?

666
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:37,063
That was a gunshot. Go, go, go!

667
00:36:45,105 --> 00:36:46,372
Put your weapon away,

668
00:36:46,406 --> 00:36:50,109
or this will be a very short meeting.

669
00:36:55,983 --> 00:36:57,283
Building 17.

670
00:36:57,317 --> 00:36:59,051
Half mile down this road.

671
00:36:59,086 --> 00:37:01,087
Come on foot.

672
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,001
What is your eta on site?

673
00:37:07,026 --> 00:37:08,039
_

674
00:37:08,064 --> 00:37:10,032
You have to move faster.

675
00:37:23,176 --> 00:37:24,877
Where's Mikhail?

676
00:37:24,911 --> 00:37:26,078
Did he defect?

677
00:37:26,112 --> 00:37:28,180
He's dead.

678
00:37:28,214 --> 00:37:29,248
When?

679
00:37:29,282 --> 00:37:30,416
Three days ago.

680
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:32,888
Killed by the SVR.

681
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,254
It was you.

682
00:37:35,288 --> 00:37:37,122
You stole the SVR's files, not Mikhail.

683
00:37:37,157 --> 00:37:40,784
_

684
00:37:40,809 --> 00:37:42,427
_

685
00:37:42,452 --> 00:37:44,439
_

686
00:37:44,464 --> 00:37:46,226
English, Alex.

687
00:37:46,353 --> 00:37:47,953
Mikhail disappeared.

688
00:37:47,978 --> 00:37:51,714
I was outside of his
apartment hoping he'd show up.

689
00:37:51,938 --> 00:37:53,973
I stole the files.

690
00:37:54,007 --> 00:37:55,107
Mikhail caught me.

691
00:37:55,141 --> 00:37:56,675
But he didn't turn you in. Why?

692
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,510
Because of what I found in them.

693
00:37:58,545 --> 00:38:00,512
The SVR operation against America?

694
00:38:00,547 --> 00:38:02,848
They're calling it "Black Dagger."

695
00:38:02,883 --> 00:38:04,650
I don't know the operation specifics,

696
00:38:04,684 --> 00:38:07,052
but the scope is monumental.

697
00:38:21,034 --> 00:38:23,636
I didn't sign up to kill innocent people

698
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,137
or do something that will start a war

699
00:38:25,171 --> 00:38:26,438
between our countries.

700
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:28,040
Why would Moscow do this?

701
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:32,011
It's not Moscow,

702
00:38:32,045 --> 00:38:35,147
at least not the political
authorities in Moscow.

703
00:38:35,181 --> 00:38:37,016
What are you saying?

704
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:39,518
That the Kremlin's lost control of the SVR.

705
00:38:39,553 --> 00:38:42,039
_

706
00:38:42,064 --> 00:38:44,183
_

707
00:38:44,183 --> 00:38:45,278
_

708
00:38:45,303 --> 00:38:46,999
_

709
00:38:47,694 --> 00:38:50,162
Mikhail secured new aliases for us.

710
00:38:50,197 --> 00:38:52,564
Aliases the SVR was unaware of.

711
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:55,292
He was about to make
contact with the Americans.

712
00:38:55,335 --> 00:38:57,503
Offering to trade the files I downloaded.

713
00:38:57,537 --> 00:38:58,904
Where are the files now?

714
00:38:58,939 --> 00:38:59,905
They're on an encrypted hard drive

715
00:38:59,939 --> 00:39:01,240
secured inside a laptop.

716
00:39:01,274 --> 00:39:02,908
Take us there. We'll protect you.

717
00:39:02,943 --> 00:39:05,678
I don't know where it is.

718
00:39:05,712 --> 00:39:06,679
What?

719
00:39:06,713 --> 00:39:08,981
I gave it to Mikhail to hide.

720
00:39:09,015 --> 00:39:10,482
Only he knows where it is.

721
00:39:10,526 --> 00:39:12,327
Only I know the password to open the drive

722
00:39:12,352 --> 00:39:13,319
and how to stop the deletion timer.

723
00:39:13,353 --> 00:39:14,520
Deletion timer?

724
00:39:14,554 --> 00:39:16,855
I uploaded a virus onto the laptop,

725
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:18,390
one that will auto-delete the files.

726
00:39:18,425 --> 00:39:20,192
It was a safeguard against either of us

727
00:39:20,226 --> 00:39:22,089
betraying the other.

728
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,437
How long?

729
00:39:25,462 --> 00:39:26,970
48 hours.

730
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:34,507
What's wrong?

731
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:37,240
- Someone's out there.
- Don't. Don't.

732
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,507
Give me the phone.

733
00:39:46,786 --> 00:39:48,520
911, where's your emergency?

734
00:39:48,555 --> 00:39:50,189
Brooklyn Navy Yard. Building 17.

735
00:39:50,223 --> 00:39:52,892
Multiple shots fired.
Federal agent requesting help.

736
00:40:05,572 --> 00:40:07,773
Move him away from the door.

737
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:17,650
We got to hold them off for
three or four minutes tops

738
00:40:17,684 --> 00:40:19,385
until NYPD gets here.

739
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:23,455
You know how to use that?

740
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:24,957
- Not really.
- Well, get it.

741
00:40:24,991 --> 00:40:26,525
And don't point it at me.

742
00:40:33,934 --> 00:40:36,469
Get down!

743
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:43,722

744
00:40:44,456 --> 00:40:46,180

746

747
00:40:52,753 --> 00:40:54,553
I'm going to tourniquet your shoulder.

748
00:41:00,727 --> 00:41:02,261
Oh.

749
00:41:02,295 --> 00:41:03,996
Uh...

750
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:05,431
You want to make the
people who did this pay,

751
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:07,166
we need to find the hard
drive with your files.

752
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,473
How?

753
00:41:08,498 --> 00:41:10,579
The aliases Mikhail didn't
tell the SVR about...

754
00:41:10,604 --> 00:41:11,943
he must have used them in hiding the drive.

755
00:41:11,968 --> 00:41:14,069
Give them to us. We'll find it.

756
00:41:17,021 --> 00:41:18,855
First alias:

757
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:21,280
