1
00:00:01,131 --> 00:00:02,739
Previously on Allegiance...

2
00:00:02,764 --> 00:00:05,313
These are files that were
on Mikhail's computer.

3
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:07,467
If it's real, then we need
to take this to the FBI.

4
00:00:07,492 --> 00:00:09,983
They have a mole inside the US government.

5
00:00:10,008 --> 00:00:11,327
The Treasury maintains a database

6
00:00:11,352 --> 00:00:13,155
to track suspicious money transfers.

7
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,850
That's for law enforcement agencies only.

8
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:16,030
CIA doesn't have access.

9
00:00:16,055 --> 00:00:18,327
But your task force is full of FBI agents.

10
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,780
I won't steal an FBI agent's access code.

11
00:00:20,805 --> 00:00:23,384
Alex, stealing the code is
what the operation requires.

12
00:00:23,409 --> 00:00:25,229
Special Agent Faber.

13
00:00:25,254 --> 00:00:27,030
Have you ever spied on your country, Alex?

14
00:00:27,056 --> 00:00:29,056
No, never.

15
00:00:29,081 --> 00:00:31,600
The money from Tolliver's bank
is going to Rome in three days.

16
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,510
We needed to figure out
a way to get you there.

17
00:00:33,535 --> 00:00:35,304
Why are you looking at me like that?

18
00:00:45,209 --> 00:00:47,061
The good news is, Intel is matching up

19
00:00:47,086 --> 00:00:48,889
to known SVR officers.

20
00:00:48,914 --> 00:00:51,257
We seem to have a Russian
Easter egg on our hands.

21
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,473
Where is the Triggerman now?

22
00:00:56,498 --> 00:00:57,772
He's on the move.

23
00:00:57,797 --> 00:01:00,014
Now, Alex, this man is
highly, highly trained.

24
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:01,239
You're not gonna be able to stand up

25
00:01:01,264 --> 00:01:02,264
in about ten minutes.

26
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:03,272
You got to let it go.

27
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:04,616
There's too much at stake.

28
00:01:04,641 --> 00:01:06,874
Alex. Hey, did you make it back okay?

29
00:01:06,898 --> 00:01:08,898
Michelle said you didn't answer her texts.

30
00:01:11,251 --> 00:01:13,155
He was escorting his own cutout.

31
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,427
I let him get away. Fadi's dead.

32
00:01:16,703 --> 00:01:18,650
I screwed up everything.

33
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:32,930
What do you see?

34
00:01:33,172 --> 00:01:34,788
Darkness.

35
00:01:34,813 --> 00:01:36,392
I'm sorry, what exactly do have

36
00:01:36,417 --> 00:01:38,374
to be so melancholy about right now?

37
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:41,778
The operation was a
success, and you got some.

38
00:01:44,151 --> 00:01:45,399
Okay, wipe that grin off your face

39
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,553
before James Bond back there catches on.

40
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:49,578
Just got off with Brock.

41
00:01:49,603 --> 00:01:51,380
Going through the data on that drive

42
00:01:51,405 --> 00:01:53,854
is like drinking from a fire hose.

43
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:57,885
Did you find anything?

44
00:01:58,571 --> 00:02:00,422
A few midlevel SVR assets.

45
00:02:00,447 --> 00:02:02,223
Nothing on Black Dagger.

46
00:02:02,248 --> 00:02:04,249
It'll take 1,000 man hours
to sift through it all.

47
00:02:04,274 --> 00:02:06,191
But we did well yesterday.

48
00:02:06,216 --> 00:02:07,774
To small victories.

49
00:02:14,429 --> 00:02:16,429
So what's your secret, Alex?

50
00:02:16,454 --> 00:02:17,830
What do you mean?

51
00:02:17,855 --> 00:02:20,166
Last night, you were puking
out your lower intestine.

52
00:02:20,191 --> 00:02:22,422
Today you look like you could go 12 rounds.

53
00:02:22,447 --> 00:02:25,974
I... sleep, I guess.

54
00:02:25,999 --> 00:02:29,221
Amazing, isn't it, what a
good night's rest can do?

55
00:02:29,246 --> 00:02:31,095
Well, the science backs it up.

56
00:02:31,563 --> 00:02:33,563
Okay, you're weird.

57
00:02:33,588 --> 00:02:36,166
That the science backs
up that sleep helps...

58
00:02:36,191 --> 00:02:38,879
- No.
- Then why?

59
00:02:38,904 --> 00:02:40,275
Alex, I'm messing with you.

60
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,744
If the last thing I do,
I'm going to teach you

61
00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:44,353
how to recognize when that is happening.

62
00:02:44,378 --> 00:02:47,378
Speaking of sleep, I want
to, so please shut up.

63
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:50,189
Princess needs her beauty rest.

64
00:02:50,797 --> 00:02:52,002
Wrong finger.

65
00:02:52,027 --> 00:02:54,366
You're blind. Your eyes are closed.

66
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:59,510
How is it that you're employed by the same
organization that tracked down bin Laden?

67
00:02:59,535 --> 00:03:00,754
Jealous?

68
00:03:00,779 --> 00:03:03,276
I will pay you to let me sleep right now.

69
00:03:03,301 --> 00:03:05,147
I'll tell you what.

70
00:03:05,274 --> 00:03:09,274
You sink this, and I'll be quiet
the entire rest of the trip.

71
00:03:09,734 --> 00:03:11,556
I will hold you to that.

72
00:03:11,844 --> 00:03:13,700
No, no, no, not that one.

73
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,770
That one.

74
00:03:19,795 --> 00:03:25,442
All right, then you say out loud that the
FBI is a superior organization to the CIA.

75
00:03:25,812 --> 00:03:27,794
Done.

76
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,648
Wow.

77
00:03:32,673 --> 00:03:36,467
Say it, and reflect on
your sins in silence.

78
00:03:37,054 --> 00:03:38,593
Is this what you meant when you said

79
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,452
don't get into a game of quarters with her?

80
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,649
My friend, it's been a lifetime.

81
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:42,311
Is everything prepared?

82
00:04:42,336 --> 00:04:43,946
All specs as you requested.

83
00:04:43,971 --> 00:04:47,258
You won't believe the detonation
velocity of such a small amount.

84
00:04:47,283 --> 00:04:48,930
Show me.

85
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,818
Of course.

86
00:04:50,843 --> 00:04:54,298
We have 10 centimeters
thick bullet-resistant glass.

87
00:04:54,607 --> 00:04:57,344
We have steel-reinforced doors and chassis.

88
00:04:57,472 --> 00:04:59,241
Several dozen currently in service

89
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:01,220
to 20 countries' heads of state.

90
00:05:04,031 --> 00:05:05,877
Yes, of course. Watch.

91
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,399
The material is flawless, I assure you.

92
00:05:20,484 --> 00:05:23,289
My idiot nephew must've
improperly wired the cap.

93
00:05:23,314 --> 00:05:25,148
Jozef.

94
00:05:28,149 --> 00:05:30,149
_

95
00:05:30,926 --> 00:05:32,474
_

96
00:05:34,446 --> 00:05:35,769
Forgive me.

97
00:05:36,008 --> 00:05:37,717
My sister's son.

98
00:05:37,741 --> 00:05:39,374
She begged me to teach him a craft,

99
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:41,710
but no good deed goes unpunished.

100
00:05:41,735 --> 00:05:43,657
It's a temporary glitch.

101
00:05:47,278 --> 00:05:49,905
_

102
00:05:50,001 --> 00:05:51,591
_

103
00:05:51,616 --> 00:05:52,967
_

104
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:04,516
As I said, you will never find a... Jozef!

105
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,047
_

106
00:06:16,374 --> 00:06:19,374
A man who cannot be trusted
to wire a blasting cap

107
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:22,121
cannot be trusted to see my face.

108
00:06:22,146 --> 00:06:23,889
Don't you agree?

109
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,250
It was a tragic accident.

110
00:06:30,275 --> 00:06:32,874
I am sorry for your loss.

111
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:38,399
That was only 1/100th of a kilo.

112
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,023
I'd like 50 kilos.

113
00:06:41,094 --> 00:06:42,271
50.

114
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,500
Do you plan on leveling a mountain?

115
00:06:59,329 --> 00:07:00,329
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

116
00:07:02,414 --> 00:07:04,474
Fadi took this picture before...

117
00:07:06,032 --> 00:07:09,032
before he was killed by this man.

118
00:07:11,711 --> 00:07:13,711
Any of you recognize him?

119
00:07:16,273 --> 00:07:18,141
No.

120
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:26,690
We have to assume this is the person
that's gonna carry out Black Dagger.

121
00:07:26,984 --> 00:07:28,334
I need to alert the task force.

122
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:29,812
And tell them what?

123
00:07:30,133 --> 00:07:32,295
That you snuck away from
a covert CIA operation

124
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,320
to follow a suspected
terrorist on your own?

125
00:07:34,374 --> 00:07:36,054
And all you have is a blurry photo

126
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,374
that could be anybody to show for it?

127
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:40,657
You can tell height, weight,
skin tone, age within 20 years.

128
00:07:40,682 --> 00:07:41,506
That's something.

129
00:07:41,531 --> 00:07:42,491
The Rezident has a mole somewhere

130
00:07:42,516 --> 00:07:44,999
with exceptional access to
CIA and FBI intelligence.

131
00:07:45,511 --> 00:07:46,674
If you tell anyone even this,

132
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:48,504
the SVR will find out and kill you.

133
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:50,132
He's right, Alex.

134
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:51,249
We need a name.

135
00:07:51,274 --> 00:07:53,218
We need something they can
follow up on and verify.

136
00:07:53,243 --> 00:07:54,570
There is an imminent attack.

137
00:07:54,594 --> 00:07:56,538
We can't just stand around talking.

138
00:07:56,563 --> 00:07:57,444
We won't.

139
00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:00,351
- We'll get a name.
- How?

140
00:08:00,376 --> 00:08:02,106
This man is a ghost.

141
00:08:02,131 --> 00:08:03,546
That's why the SVR hired him.

142
00:08:03,571 --> 00:08:05,343
Well, then the SVR knows who he is.

143
00:08:05,368 --> 00:08:06,273
The Rezident knows.

144
00:08:06,297 --> 00:08:07,652
Maybe if I ask him, he'll tell me.

145
00:08:07,678 --> 00:08:08,971
Try that. See how it goes.

146
00:08:08,996 --> 00:08:13,203
- If we got listening devices in his office...
- We? You mean me.

147
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:14,560
Of course.

148
00:08:14,585 --> 00:08:17,381
Bugging an SVR rezident is out of reach

149
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,519
for anyone but an insider.

150
00:08:18,544 --> 00:08:21,206
We get a bug in the Rezident's office.

151
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:24,443
Then we lead him to believe the CIA
caught on to Black Dagger in some way.

152
00:08:24,468 --> 00:08:26,515
If we're lucky, he contacts the Triggerman.

153
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,280
You have to sign in at the guard desk

154
00:08:28,305 --> 00:08:31,372
to even get access to the area with the
file vault and the Rezident's office.

155
00:08:31,397 --> 00:08:34,027
They do an electronic
sweep every other day.

156
00:08:34,053 --> 00:08:38,485
If it gets discovered, I will be
on a very short list of suspects.

157
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,885
The electronic sweep won't detect anything

158
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:42,909
if there's no electronics to detect.

159
00:08:42,934 --> 00:08:43,934
What?

160
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:47,557
I can modify the bug to experience a
power surge 24 hours after you plant it.

161
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:51,490
The surge fries the
electronics. Voila, undetectable.

162
00:08:51,515 --> 00:08:53,185
MIT.

163
00:08:57,386 --> 00:08:59,810
We'll need to bug his car as well.

164
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:07,391
Got your message. Come on, you're buying.

165
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,274
Rain check. Got to be back in four hours.

166
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,015
I remember the days we
used to drink all night

167
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:11,993
and still make the turnaround.

168
00:09:12,017 --> 00:09:13,017
- Remember that?
- Yeah, long time ago.

169
00:09:13,042 --> 00:09:15,656
Yeah, so what did you want to talk about?

170
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:17,140
This is off the record.

171
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,797
I'm just looking for some advice right now.

172
00:09:18,822 --> 00:09:19,676
Okay.

173
00:09:19,824 --> 00:09:21,287
Well, you know I spent most of my career

174
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:23,406
looking outside the agency for bad guys,

175
00:09:23,431 --> 00:09:25,328
people who were dirty, weak, ripe to turn.

176
00:09:25,353 --> 00:09:27,353
Objectively speaking,
I'm good at spotting them.

177
00:09:27,378 --> 00:09:28,117
Agreed.

178
00:09:28,142 --> 00:09:30,258
Hate to admit it, but agreed.

179
00:09:30,283 --> 00:09:32,512
But I've never had to look
inside at my own people.

180
00:09:32,537 --> 00:09:34,328
Never had a reason.

181
00:09:34,353 --> 00:09:39,816
Theoretically speaking, what am I supposed to look for
to spot someone who might be working for the other side?

182
00:09:40,674 --> 00:09:43,097
Think of it like a cheating spouse.

183
00:09:43,122 --> 00:09:45,328
It's the little things you
can't put your finger on.

184
00:09:45,353 --> 00:09:48,443
White lies, half truths,
unexplained absences,

185
00:09:48,468 --> 00:09:52,468
an inflection in the voice,
hyper-protest of innocence.

186
00:09:52,493 --> 00:09:55,452
Human beings out to
deceive have the same tells.

187
00:09:55,792 --> 00:09:57,440
Who?

188
00:09:57,746 --> 00:09:59,477
It's not important right now.

189
00:09:59,502 --> 00:10:02,502
Yeah, so it's the boy genius
you took under your wing.

190
00:10:02,527 --> 00:10:03,476
Alex O'Connor.

191
00:10:03,501 --> 00:10:04,881
Very nice, Faber. Very nice.

192
00:10:04,906 --> 00:10:07,303
Objectively speaking,
I'm pretty good at my job.

193
00:10:07,328 --> 00:10:09,279
I got a weird feeling about this, Jason.

194
00:10:09,304 --> 00:10:12,304
Feelings aren't facts, Sam.

195
00:10:12,329 --> 00:10:15,151
You start pointing
fingers. You get it wrong.

196
00:10:15,176 --> 00:10:16,783
You might burn down a promising career

197
00:10:16,808 --> 00:10:17,883
before it gets off the ground.

198
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,072
All right, well, this is an
off-the-record conversation.

199
00:10:20,097 --> 00:10:20,937
What do you think?

200
00:10:20,962 --> 00:10:23,671
Honestly, based on what I saw
and what you told me about him,

201
00:10:24,253 --> 00:10:29,372
I don't think someone whose mind works as differently
as O'Connor's could hold it together as a double agent.

202
00:10:29,397 --> 00:10:31,574
Now, that said, you
should keep an eye on him.

203
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:32,851
Does something else unexplained.

204
00:10:32,876 --> 00:10:34,366
Maybe we get a surveillance order.

205
00:10:34,391 --> 00:10:35,879
Dig deeper on him.

206
00:10:37,212 --> 00:10:38,478
All right, thanks, Jay.

207
00:10:38,503 --> 00:10:40,095
I owe you one.

208
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:42,168
Last one.

209
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:50,017
When we lost contact with you in Rome,

210
00:10:50,464 --> 00:10:56,913
as awful as the thought was of
losing you, I felt something else.

211
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:01,106
Pride.

212
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:03,674
Going after that operative by yourself,

213
00:11:03,699 --> 00:11:05,699
that was brave, Alex.

214
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:12,051
I wish I could tell you this
was all gonna be over soon,

215
00:11:12,909 --> 00:11:14,909
but bugging the Rezident is daunting.

216
00:11:15,285 --> 00:11:17,285
We need a backup plan.

217
00:11:17,496 --> 00:11:19,495
In case he kills us all?

218
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,835
- Natalie.
- It's the truth, Dad.

219
00:11:22,292 --> 00:11:24,765
Alex is a part of all this now.

220
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:27,250
He needs to confront what it really is.

221
00:11:31,675 --> 00:11:33,674
Somehow we need to alert the task force

222
00:11:33,699 --> 00:11:35,452
that the operative in
charge of Black Dagger

223
00:11:35,477 --> 00:11:36,477
is on his way here.

224
00:11:36,502 --> 00:11:39,262
It just can't come from you, not directly.

225
00:11:39,287 --> 00:11:40,961
Victor is right.

226
00:11:40,986 --> 00:11:42,986
The mole would come after you.

227
00:11:43,027 --> 00:11:44,553
Dad and I have an idea.

228
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,578
We plant a letter for
the task force to find

229
00:11:46,603 --> 00:11:48,603
in the SVR cache that we created

230
00:11:48,628 --> 00:11:50,473
that you recovered in Italy.

231
00:11:50,498 --> 00:11:52,359
A letter ordering the Rezident

232
00:11:52,384 --> 00:11:56,383
to help prepare for the arrival of the
operative in New York to carry out Black Dagger.

233
00:11:56,408 --> 00:11:58,008
In order to add to the cache,

234
00:11:58,033 --> 00:11:59,383
I'd need to have unfettered access

235
00:11:59,408 --> 00:12:00,301
to the FBI server.

236
00:12:00,326 --> 00:12:02,993
You still have your partner
Michelle's log-in codes, right?

237
00:12:05,695 --> 00:12:06,847
All right.

238
00:12:06,872 --> 00:12:08,273
It'll take me a day to create a document

239
00:12:08,298 --> 00:12:10,876
that will bed-in well enough
with what we already created.

240
00:12:11,026 --> 00:12:12,549
I'll text you.

241
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:27,329
Hey, do you know who those people are?

242
00:12:27,354 --> 00:12:29,354
Computer analysis response team.

243
00:12:29,379 --> 00:12:30,379
They arrived overnight.

244
00:12:30,404 --> 00:12:33,219
They've combed through 5%
of the SVR cache so far.

245
00:12:33,577 --> 00:12:36,083
Anything about Black Dagger?

246
00:12:36,108 --> 00:12:37,803
Not yet.

247
00:12:43,097 --> 00:12:45,664
Hey, I'm thinking I
need a change of scenery.

248
00:12:45,689 --> 00:12:48,488
Too long in one place, my mind shuts down.

249
00:12:48,513 --> 00:12:50,513
What time did you get in this morning?

250
00:12:50,538 --> 00:12:52,327
Half hour ago.

251
00:12:52,352 --> 00:12:54,445
We can't do anything
until the computer team

252
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,010
finishes their search anyway.

253
00:12:56,745 --> 00:12:58,307
Let's go work at my place.

254
00:12:58,332 --> 00:13:00,130
We'll be more productive.

255
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:02,155
How would it be more productive?

256
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,027
Anything we can do there, we can do here.

257
00:13:04,052 --> 00:13:06,052
Not everything, Alex.

258
00:13:11,401 --> 00:13:14,401
I told you we'd get more done here.

259
00:13:17,362 --> 00:13:19,748
You're so beautiful.

260
00:13:31,472 --> 00:13:34,172
We have a leak inside SVR.

261
00:13:34,197 --> 00:13:35,973
I don't have all the details,

262
00:13:35,998 --> 00:13:37,933
but the Americans got their
hands on a data cache...

263
00:13:39,792 --> 00:13:40,792
No.

264
00:13:41,074 --> 00:13:44,074
Information stolen was
only moderately sensitive,

265
00:13:44,099 --> 00:13:48,327
though the cover of several of
our diplomatic officers was blown.

266
00:13:49,636 --> 00:13:51,377
Oh.

267
00:13:51,402 --> 00:13:53,402
No one important.

268
00:13:53,628 --> 00:13:59,627
Here's the latest, but this feels like an overture
from one of our operatives to the Americans.

269
00:13:59,652 --> 00:14:02,494
The way of establishing
he has real information

270
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,445
in exchange for immunity.

271
00:14:04,703 --> 00:14:08,112
_

272
00:14:08,804 --> 00:14:11,318
_

273
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,955
_

274
00:14:15,331 --> 00:14:18,491
Never mind. I will do it myself.

275
00:14:23,245 --> 00:14:24,881
Tim...

276
00:14:26,005 --> 00:14:27,796
_

277
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:32,409
That was a good night.

278
00:14:32,434 --> 00:14:35,435
Grocery bags in our boots
so the dogs lost our scent.

279
00:14:35,596 --> 00:14:38,274
But you were the best in our class, Dmitri.

280
00:14:39,082 --> 00:14:40,199
The big man.

281
00:14:40,224 --> 00:14:43,079
Now I drive the big man.

282
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:46,961
And I admire your self-control.

283
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:50,458
If an idiot accidently shot
me in the knee on the range...

284
00:14:50,482 --> 00:14:53,181
_

285
00:14:55,212 --> 00:14:59,793
_

286
00:15:00,451 --> 00:15:04,313
_

287
00:15:04,535 --> 00:15:07,148
_

288
00:15:07,254 --> 00:15:11,254
Sometimes I think that bullet was
the best thing to happen to me.

289
00:15:14,354 --> 00:15:17,354
I need to use the facilities.

290
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:50,904
Thanks for the beer and the conversation.

291
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:52,761
We should do this again.

292
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,895
One more. My wife texted.

293
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,811
If I'm not there for
bedtime, she'll have my head.

294
00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:06,724
Is that Sacha?

295
00:16:07,355 --> 00:16:10,188
My God, he's huge.

296
00:16:10,213 --> 00:16:12,796
Time passes, huh?

297
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:17,269
He plays linebacker for his football team.

298
00:16:17,294 --> 00:16:19,108
Not hockey.

299
00:16:19,133 --> 00:16:21,122
Treason, I know.

300
00:16:22,425 --> 00:16:24,303
My friend.

301
00:16:30,183 --> 00:16:32,184
Buh-bye. You as well.

302
00:16:53,237 --> 00:16:54,642
This is really good.

303
00:16:55,158 --> 00:16:56,859
It's hard to screw up eggs.

304
00:16:56,978 --> 00:16:58,715
I can.

305
00:17:01,408 --> 00:17:03,134
Not in this house.

306
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:04,791
Sorry.

307
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:08,341
I-I usually read when I eat.

308
00:17:08,366 --> 00:17:11,186
I noticed. Why is that?

309
00:17:11,244 --> 00:17:13,244
I never know where to look.

310
00:17:13,892 --> 00:17:15,892
Look down, you're being rude.

311
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:20,917
Too much eye contact, and
people think you're weird.

312
00:17:21,017 --> 00:17:26,274
Facts, numbers, patterns,
they make sense to me.

313
00:17:26,299 --> 00:17:29,134
People... people don't.

314
00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:32,259
- They're...
- Irrational, erratic, inconsistent.

315
00:17:32,729 --> 00:17:37,729
Not knowing what people will do, that's
what makes life interesting, Alex.

316
00:17:37,947 --> 00:17:42,484
Never thought I'd be "dating"
my partner, for example.

317
00:17:42,509 --> 00:17:44,509
Are we dating?

318
00:17:44,534 --> 00:17:47,534
That's a polite way to say it, yes.

319
00:17:47,713 --> 00:17:49,249
That's what the air quotes were for.

320
00:17:49,274 --> 00:17:50,538
What?

321
00:17:51,611 --> 00:17:53,611
Never mind.

322
00:17:53,924 --> 00:17:56,573
Yes, we're dating.

323
00:17:56,598 --> 00:17:59,629
So no side projects from now on, okay?

324
00:18:00,681 --> 00:18:01,933
Sure.

325
00:18:06,924 --> 00:18:08,676
What's wrong?

326
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,108
Oh, uh, nothing.

327
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:14,344
I have to stop by my sister's apartment

328
00:18:14,369 --> 00:18:16,226
on the way to work.

329
00:18:18,486 --> 00:18:20,274
Meet Cindy Reynolds.

330
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:23,848
She's an SVR asset working for
the New York Stock Exchange.

331
00:18:23,873 --> 00:18:25,703
We're making it look like she's receiving

332
00:18:25,728 --> 00:18:30,493
secret orders from Moscow to arrange a drop for
the operative who's gonna carry out Black Dagger.

333
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,285
Now I embed the file into a jpeg

334
00:18:35,096 --> 00:18:39,096
and plant it in the dot over
the I in "Cindy" like so.

335
00:18:39,121 --> 00:18:40,923
Steganography.

336
00:18:40,948 --> 00:18:43,766
When the task force does
a scan and finds this,

337
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,055
they'll know the Triggerman is here

338
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,527
along with his age, race, and body type.

339
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,183
Any questions?

340
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,024
What does it mean when a
girl says, "No side projects"?

341
00:18:56,978 --> 00:18:58,978
Oh, my God.

342
00:18:59,143 --> 00:19:00,495
What?

343
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,249
You have a girlfriend.

344
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:07,672
- No, no, I just...
- Alex, that's... that's awesome.

345
00:19:07,697 --> 00:19:09,895
I'm really happy for you.

346
00:19:10,439 --> 00:19:12,184
Thanks.

347
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:15,726
So what does it mean, this
no side projects thing?

348
00:19:15,751 --> 00:19:17,839
You're the dumbest genius ever.

349
00:19:18,275 --> 00:19:22,430
It means she doesn't want you
sleeping with other people.

350
00:19:22,455 --> 00:19:25,163
What? Why would I do that?

351
00:19:25,188 --> 00:19:28,060
Well, you wouldn't.

352
00:19:28,423 --> 00:19:30,423
Is this someone from work?

353
00:19:31,181 --> 00:19:33,181
Holy crap. Alex.

354
00:19:35,892 --> 00:19:38,892
Can we not tell mom about this?

355
00:19:39,134 --> 00:19:41,134
The last thing I want to talk to mom about

356
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:43,429
is your love life.

357
00:19:44,009 --> 00:19:48,637
Romance at work. Tricky.

358
00:19:50,103 --> 00:19:56,413
Have you ever, you know,
been with someone from work?

359
00:19:57,251 --> 00:19:59,367
Yeah.

360
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:06,118
Is this the woman whose
access codes you stole?

361
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,525
The codes you're gonna
need to plant the file?

362
00:20:13,113 --> 00:20:15,726
I'm sorry.

363
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:19,017
Just remember, what you're doing

364
00:20:19,042 --> 00:20:20,744
is gonna keep a lot of people safe,

365
00:20:20,964 --> 00:20:22,964
including her.

366
00:20:37,268 --> 00:20:39,268
Are you okay?

367
00:20:39,293 --> 00:20:41,222
Fine.

368
00:20:41,369 --> 00:20:44,510
My mom's all over me to fly
home to San Antonio tonight.

369
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,535
You don't like seeing your mom?

370
00:20:49,697 --> 00:20:52,698
Tomorrow's the anniversary
of my sister's death.

371
00:20:53,814 --> 00:20:57,386
Not sure getting together to cry over a
slab of granite will make us feel better.

372
00:20:57,411 --> 00:21:00,011
Maybe your mom needs you there.

373
00:21:00,518 --> 00:21:02,170
No.

374
00:21:04,993 --> 00:21:07,834
She wants me there so she can blame me.

375
00:21:09,064 --> 00:21:11,604
I got drunk at a bar.

376
00:21:13,104 --> 00:21:17,788
I didn't want to drive home, so I called
my sister, and she came and picked me up.

377
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:23,903
We got sideswiped. I
walked away; she didn't.

378
00:21:24,906 --> 00:21:27,820
I'm sorry.

379
00:21:29,002 --> 00:21:31,255
She was gonna be a doctor.

380
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,487
She would've saved lives.

381
00:21:33,513 --> 00:21:36,399
You save lives.

382
00:21:37,501 --> 00:21:40,151
You saved mine in Brighton Park,

383
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,666
and you'll save more
when we stop Black Dagger.

384
00:21:44,462 --> 00:21:47,730
You truly believe that, don't you?

385
00:21:48,127 --> 00:21:50,774
- That we'll stop it.
- Yes.

386
00:21:53,744 --> 00:21:56,700
I never met anyone like you, Alex.

387
00:22:05,892 --> 00:22:08,409
There's more thumb than
office in a lot of these.

388
00:22:08,434 --> 00:22:12,169
You try taking covert photos in the middle
of a meeting with a paranoid spymaster.

389
00:22:12,195 --> 00:22:15,677
So from what you're describing, trying
to go in at night would be riskier

390
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,468
than going in during the
day when the alarms are off.

391
00:22:17,494 --> 00:22:19,274
Sure, I only have to know in advance

392
00:22:19,299 --> 00:22:20,966
when the Rezident won't be in the building,

393
00:22:20,991 --> 00:22:22,701
find a way to get into his
office without being seen,

394
00:22:22,726 --> 00:22:23,623
and then plant a bug.

395
00:22:23,648 --> 00:22:25,199
There has to be a time during the day

396
00:22:25,223 --> 00:22:26,918
where he leaves the office regularly.

397
00:22:26,943 --> 00:22:28,568
He takes his dog for
a walk around the block

398
00:22:28,593 --> 00:22:29,560
a couple of times a day.

399
00:22:29,585 --> 00:22:30,666
Then there's your window.

400
00:22:30,691 --> 00:22:34,408
And for the bug, I can put it in a
decanter stopper like this one here.

401
00:22:34,838 --> 00:22:36,529
You just have to get
into the private office

402
00:22:36,554 --> 00:22:37,812
and switch it out.

403
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:40,827
Are you sure you can replicate it exactly?

404
00:22:40,852 --> 00:22:42,078
Every scratch, every mark.

405
00:22:42,103 --> 00:22:43,818
It must be exact.

406
00:22:43,843 --> 00:22:47,121
He's incredible with his hands.

407
00:22:56,111 --> 00:22:58,111
Still no sign of him out front.

408
00:22:58,136 --> 00:22:59,966
Stay at least a foot back from the window,

409
00:22:59,991 --> 00:23:01,638
or the infrared cameras will pick you up.

410
00:23:01,664 --> 00:23:02,664
Relax.

411
00:23:02,689 --> 00:23:05,103
Everything's under control.

412
00:23:09,486 --> 00:23:11,289
Rezident's on the move, go.

413
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:50,696
It's not here.

414
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,470
What? What's not there?

415
00:23:52,495 --> 00:23:56,181
The decanter, the thing
I was supposed to bug.

416
00:23:56,206 --> 00:23:57,274
The glasses are gone too.

417
00:23:58,257 --> 00:24:03,342
- We should abort. Victor...
- We can't abort. This is our only chance.

418
00:24:03,736 --> 00:24:05,736
I have an idea.

419
00:24:05,761 --> 00:24:07,553
What are you gonna do?

420
00:24:07,658 --> 00:24:09,706
Improvise.

421
00:24:30,236 --> 00:24:32,961
He's on his way back. We're out of time.

422
00:24:32,986 --> 00:24:34,514
I just need one more minute.

423
00:24:35,845 --> 00:24:37,625
He's coming your way. He's coming inside.

424
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:48,009
I'm done.

425
00:24:48,034 --> 00:24:50,034
Then get the hell out of there.

426
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:54,119
If he catches you in
there, he's gonna kill you.

427
00:25:49,126 --> 00:25:52,113
Alex, what are you doing here?

428
00:25:52,138 --> 00:25:55,402
Uh, Brock gave us a lot to analyze.

429
00:25:55,668 --> 00:25:59,049
You came in at 2:00 AM to analyze.

430
00:25:59,074 --> 00:26:01,375
I had to cross-reference a
file with one on my desktop.

431
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,615
What are you doing here at 2:00 AM?

432
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,371
Sleep cycle's out of whack from Rome.

433
00:26:07,161 --> 00:26:09,636
So did you find anything?

434
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:14,093
- No.
- Nothing that's odd?

435
00:26:14,763 --> 00:26:20,931
I mean, we had solid Intel that the documents we were going for
in Rome were Mikhail's documents, that it would be a treasure trove

436
00:26:20,956 --> 00:26:22,697
of information about the SVR.

437
00:26:23,074 --> 00:26:26,074
The cache has yielded the identities
of several undercover SVR officers.

438
00:26:26,099 --> 00:26:28,636
Minnows. Paper pushers.

439
00:26:28,661 --> 00:26:30,243
What if this whole thing was just a play

440
00:26:30,268 --> 00:26:31,635
to get us to spin our wheels?

441
00:26:31,659 --> 00:26:35,451
Fly half way around the world
chasing a false lead in Rome.

442
00:26:36,849 --> 00:26:40,586
Well, the SVR would have to be ten
steps ahead of us to pull that off.

443
00:26:40,611 --> 00:26:42,410
That seems impossible.

444
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:48,539
Unless they had help, but that
doesn't seem likely, does it?

445
00:26:52,051 --> 00:26:53,267
See you later.

446
00:27:13,544 --> 00:27:15,509
So what more do you have for me?

447
00:27:15,534 --> 00:27:19,793
The files, names of our
officers, were acquired in Rome.

448
00:27:20,075 --> 00:27:22,074
- How?
- Don't have that yet.

449
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:24,099
But I do know the Americans were tracking

450
00:27:24,099 --> 00:27:25,898
a double homicide in Rome.

451
00:27:25,942 --> 00:27:29,074
An ex-KGB operative and a Camorra member

452
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:30,874
known to move money for black ops.

453
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,899
The CIA believes they are connected

454
00:27:32,924 --> 00:27:34,074
to chatter about an imminent attack

455
00:27:34,099 --> 00:27:36,280
on American soil.

456
00:27:37,716 --> 00:27:39,254
Anything else?

457
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,273
Not yet.

458
00:27:40,298 --> 00:27:42,529
Thank you, Victor. That will be all.

459
00:27:48,825 --> 00:27:50,736
Are there any loose ends in Rome?

460
00:27:50,761 --> 00:27:53,233
I don't leave loose ends.

461
00:28:02,075 --> 00:28:06,370
Our colleagues from the other side
are looking into a tragic incident.

462
00:28:06,395 --> 00:28:08,500
Let them.

463
00:28:09,817 --> 00:28:13,249
Has everything been arranged?

464
00:28:33,551 --> 00:28:35,551
Hey. Hey.

465
00:28:35,576 --> 00:28:36,576
Want a drink?

466
00:28:36,601 --> 00:28:38,700
No, I'm fine.

467
00:28:39,809 --> 00:28:42,413
So why the off-campus visit?

468
00:28:45,443 --> 00:28:48,011
I need this to stay between us.

469
00:28:48,669 --> 00:28:49,669
What is it?

470
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:51,694
It's probably nothing.

471
00:28:51,719 --> 00:28:54,719
I'm just worried that Alex might be hiding

472
00:28:54,744 --> 00:28:55,744
something from me.

473
00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:57,445
Really?

474
00:28:58,677 --> 00:29:01,677
Last night, he came into the
office at 2:00 in the morning.

475
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:04,074
- He says he never sleeps.
- Yeah, I know.

476
00:29:04,099 --> 00:29:05,822
- He says that.
- You don't seem convinced.

477
00:29:05,847 --> 00:29:11,332
No, he was acting... I don't
know. He's been off since Rome.

478
00:29:11,357 --> 00:29:14,594
white lies, vocal pattern stress.

479
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:17,313
I ask direct questions he avoids.

480
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:20,068
I think something happened in Italy.

481
00:29:23,099 --> 00:29:26,046
Sam, you may be right.

482
00:29:26,071 --> 00:29:28,597
Something did happen in Italy.

483
00:29:28,622 --> 00:29:30,511
- You saw something.
- Yes.

484
00:29:30,536 --> 00:29:31,536
Involving Alex.

485
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:34,199
What I saw definitely involved Alex.

486
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:41,028
Wait, you didn't...

487
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:46,490
I did not see that coming.

488
00:29:46,515 --> 00:29:47,515
I said I could coach.

489
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,040
You and Alex?

490
00:29:49,065 --> 00:29:53,414
Sex with Alex O'Connor?

491
00:29:53,896 --> 00:29:55,987
Feel better?

492
00:29:56,012 --> 00:30:01,659
About Alex, yes, not about the
fairness of the universe, to be frank.

493
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:06,679
I will have that drink now.

494
00:30:11,669 --> 00:30:15,668
Our colleagues from the other side
are looking into a tragic incident.

495
00:30:15,693 --> 00:30:16,693
Let them.

496
00:30:16,718 --> 00:30:18,332
Has everything been arranged?

497
00:30:18,357 --> 00:30:22,058
Friends will be waiting
at Campbell's, 4:00.

498
00:30:22,786 --> 00:30:27,074
Victor's doing some digging to try to see if
there's an SVR asset or a site code named Campbell.

499
00:30:27,099 --> 00:30:28,630
In the meantime, I hacked Customs

500
00:30:28,655 --> 00:30:30,247
who were taking passport
photos of everybody

501
00:30:30,272 --> 00:30:32,813
arriving from France, Ivory
Coast, Monaco, Belgium.

502
00:30:32,838 --> 00:30:35,244
He's from Canada, Quebec.

503
00:30:35,528 --> 00:30:37,074
How could you possibly know that?

504
00:30:37,099 --> 00:30:41,098
Well, he ordered poutine, a signature dish
of Quebec, and a croakmatin, a local beer.

505
00:30:41,099 --> 00:30:42,339
It's hard to find outside of the province.

506
00:30:42,364 --> 00:30:44,174
How long ago did you make this recording?

507
00:30:44,794 --> 00:30:46,074
Three hours.

508
00:30:46,099 --> 00:30:48,099
The flight from Quebec
to New York is two hours.

509
00:30:48,099 --> 00:30:50,884
He's already here. He's in the country.

510
00:30:55,136 --> 00:30:56,294
Alex, where are you going?

511
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:57,213
Task force.

512
00:30:57,238 --> 00:31:00,237
They have to know the operative in charge of
Black Dagger's here, and they need to know now.

513
00:31:00,262 --> 00:31:01,765
I'll pretend to find the file.

514
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:02,834
We can't wait for the techs.

515
00:31:02,858 --> 00:31:04,788
You cannot be the one to discover it.

516
00:31:04,813 --> 00:31:07,013
The mole will kill you. Do
you understand that, Alex?

517
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:09,597
A friend is waiting at Campbell's.

518
00:31:09,622 --> 00:31:10,982
I mean, what if it isn't a code name?

519
00:31:11,007 --> 00:31:12,680
What if it's Campbell's Apartment,

520
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:14,705
the cocktail lounge at
Grand Central Station?

521
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,493
They were on a highly secure line,

522
00:31:16,518 --> 00:31:18,043
and they weren't
bothering to use code words

523
00:31:18,068 --> 00:31:19,029
throughout the whole conversation.

524
00:31:19,054 --> 00:31:19,823
It's possible.

525
00:31:19,848 --> 00:31:23,075
Even if you're right, the Rezident said the
meeting was at 4:00; that was 20 minutes ago.

526
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,100
We can get the security
footage from Grand Central.

527
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:27,672
Just give us a little bit more time.

528
00:31:29,174 --> 00:31:31,574
So you get any clarity on O'Connor?

529
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:33,174
You were right.

530
00:31:33,199 --> 00:31:35,199
The night he disappeared,
he was out getting laid.

531
00:31:35,199 --> 00:31:36,414
Hey.

532
00:31:36,439 --> 00:31:38,174
Well, I suppose you should find out who.

533
00:31:38,199 --> 00:31:40,083
Make sure she's not an SVR sparrow.

534
00:31:40,108 --> 00:31:41,600
I already know who.

535
00:31:41,706 --> 00:31:43,569
Every once in a while, you impress me.

536
00:31:43,594 --> 00:31:44,594
You know that?

537
00:31:44,619 --> 00:31:46,137
Who?

538
00:31:46,652 --> 00:31:47,746
This stays between us?

539
00:31:47,771 --> 00:31:49,174
Come on, if you don't know that by now...

540
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:51,501
Michelle Prado.

541
00:31:52,199 --> 00:31:53,199
Prado, really?

542
00:31:53,199 --> 00:31:55,199
I know. Can you believe it?

543
00:31:56,199 --> 00:31:58,199
I read the kid's file
when I polygraphed him.

544
00:31:58,199 --> 00:32:00,199
He couldn't check a box
for sexual orientation.

545
00:32:00,199 --> 00:32:01,682
Well, mystery solved.

546
00:32:01,737 --> 00:32:03,953
No known romantic
relationships in his history.

547
00:32:03,978 --> 00:32:08,546
Now, suddenly he ends up
in bed with Michelle Prado.

548
00:32:08,571 --> 00:32:09,642
How does that work?

549
00:32:09,667 --> 00:32:11,076
Maybe Michelle likes misfits.

550
00:32:11,101 --> 00:32:13,192
Yeah, maybe, maybe.

551
00:32:37,534 --> 00:32:38,953
_

552
00:32:54,886 --> 00:32:56,857
What is this?

553
00:32:57,472 --> 00:32:59,139
Our rat, Victor.

554
00:33:01,088 --> 00:33:02,174
This was in my car.

555
00:33:02,199 --> 00:33:05,009
It wasn't me! Tell him, Victor.

556
00:33:05,034 --> 00:33:06,955
You know I was...

557
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:10,664
Dmitri says you will vouch for him.

558
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,300
I will.

559
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:16,058
- Dmitri is loyal.
- I disagree.

560
00:33:16,925 --> 00:33:19,042
I believe Dmitri used to be loyal

561
00:33:19,067 --> 00:33:20,628
back when he thought he was destined

562
00:33:20,653 --> 00:33:22,173
to run the Service.

563
00:33:24,988 --> 00:33:29,117
But then a stray bullet
felled a great career.

564
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:32,845
It was my mistake to hire him as my driver.

565
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:41,370
To be that close to center stage without
being in the spotlight, it led to bitterness.

566
00:33:41,417 --> 00:33:43,417
This man has a family.

567
00:33:44,011 --> 00:33:46,011
He's happy.

568
00:33:46,174 --> 00:33:47,808
He would never betray us.

569
00:33:47,833 --> 00:33:48,832
I have two children. Please.

570
00:33:48,857 --> 00:33:51,174
Shut up! Shut up!

571
00:33:51,199 --> 00:33:53,199
He hears everything you say anyway.

572
00:33:53,224 --> 00:33:55,830
Why would he need to bug your car?

573
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,878
Someone could've broken in there

574
00:33:57,903 --> 00:33:59,545
while he was away.

575
00:34:00,035 --> 00:34:02,035
Possibly.

576
00:34:02,174 --> 00:34:06,174
But that would mean
Dmitri failed at his duties

577
00:34:06,199 --> 00:34:09,857
to protect my car, to protect me,

578
00:34:10,183 --> 00:34:13,184
and if not that, he must
be a spy for the Americans.

579
00:34:15,174 --> 00:34:20,174
No matter which, the
consequence is the same.

580
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:20,925
No, don't!

581
00:34:43,682 --> 00:34:46,933
- Cindy Reynolds.
- Who?

582
00:34:46,958 --> 00:34:48,530
Cindy Reynolds, she's an employee

583
00:34:48,555 --> 00:34:51,812
at the New York Stock
Exchange, an asset of the SVR.

584
00:34:52,425 --> 00:34:53,728
And?

585
00:34:53,753 --> 00:34:57,058
She majored in forensic science
at the University of Iowa.

586
00:34:57,902 --> 00:35:00,902
And this is more important
than my mu shu pork because...

587
00:35:00,927 --> 00:35:02,872
Oh, it's a curriculum
heavy with steganography.

588
00:35:02,897 --> 00:35:04,691
She knows how to send and
receive hidden messages

589
00:35:04,716 --> 00:35:05,716
in everyday documents.

590
00:35:05,965 --> 00:35:07,330
You found one of these messages?

591
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,917
Not in my files, but there's letters

592
00:35:09,942 --> 00:35:12,174
between her and the SVR in
the cache we got in Rome.

593
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:14,199
I think she could be
connected to Black Dagger.

594
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:17,936
We should run a jpeg scan of
all of her correspondence now.

595
00:35:17,961 --> 00:35:19,961
Get it to the computer analysts.

596
00:35:19,986 --> 00:35:22,742
Have them look at it
within the next 24 hours.

597
00:35:22,767 --> 00:35:25,229
No, we can't wait. We shouldn't wait.

598
00:35:25,254 --> 00:35:28,141
I mean, I can run it.

599
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,213
Every piece of
correspondence Cindy Reynolds

600
00:35:32,238 --> 00:35:34,749
sent or received in the past year.

601
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:40,294
Knock yourself out.

602
00:35:56,224 --> 00:35:58,567
I'll be damned.

603
00:36:05,996 --> 00:36:08,113
Nothing.

604
00:36:08,215 --> 00:36:10,599
No, that's impossible.

605
00:36:11,331 --> 00:36:13,762
It's a hidden jpeg. It
shouldn't even be here.

606
00:36:13,787 --> 00:36:14,787
Why is it empty?

607
00:36:14,812 --> 00:36:18,320
I have no idea, but I do know this.

608
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,531
Nothing worse than cold mu shu.

609
00:36:31,769 --> 00:36:34,083
Hey. It wasn't there... the file.

610
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,660
I opened the jpeg. It was empty.

611
00:36:35,685 --> 00:36:37,685
That's impossible.

612
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,705
You coded it, right?

613
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:41,873
If it's gone, that's because
someone went in and erased it.

614
00:36:41,898 --> 00:36:44,042
We need to get what we know
to the authorities right away.

615
00:36:44,067 --> 00:36:46,377
Could you get into the
NYPD's real-time crime center?

616
00:36:46,402 --> 00:36:47,114
Yes.

617
00:36:47,139 --> 00:36:49,525
Put out a be-on-lookout
notice on him in the system.

618
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:51,149
Suspect in a double homicide in Rome

619
00:36:51,174 --> 00:36:52,055
believed to be hiding in New York,

620
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,016
and include the blurry
photo we have of him.

621
00:36:54,041 --> 00:36:55,632
Say it's from an Italian security camera.

622
00:36:55,656 --> 00:36:57,519
Even if the BOLO went out tonight,

623
00:36:57,544 --> 00:36:58,963
tomorrow when the foreign
liaison team gets in,

624
00:36:58,988 --> 00:37:00,371
they're gonna call Rome to follow up.

625
00:37:00,395 --> 00:37:01,986
They're gonna figure out
the request was a fake,

626
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:03,947
and they're gonna come
looking for whoever planted it.

627
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:05,972
So we get eight hours of
cops scouring the city.

628
00:37:05,997 --> 00:37:07,237
We get to use their eyes too.

629
00:37:07,262 --> 00:37:09,181
Look, I have to go.

630
00:37:15,214 --> 00:37:16,927
Hey.

631
00:37:17,995 --> 00:37:19,174
What's wrong?

632
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:21,403
I need to tell you something.

633
00:37:21,878 --> 00:37:24,003
Okay.

634
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:26,519
I've been lying to you.

635
00:37:26,933 --> 00:37:29,132
About what?

636
00:37:31,566 --> 00:37:33,566
Everything.

637
00:37:38,568 --> 00:37:39,568
You've seen the operative

638
00:37:39,593 --> 00:37:41,545
who's running Black Dagger in person.

639
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:43,013
I saw him kill two men in Rome.

640
00:37:43,038 --> 00:37:44,397
I have a picture of him from there.

641
00:37:44,422 --> 00:37:46,844
And rather than tell me or Sam or anyone,

642
00:37:46,869 --> 00:37:48,540
you pursue it on your own.

643
00:37:48,565 --> 00:37:50,069
I had no choice.

644
00:37:50,094 --> 00:37:52,814
There's a mole, I think, in the task force.

645
00:37:52,839 --> 00:37:54,659
What makes you think that?

646
00:37:54,684 --> 00:37:56,975
I planted a file about the
operative on the FBI server

647
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,999
so the techs would discover that he's here.

648
00:37:58,999 --> 00:38:00,613
They missed it, so I went to Brock.

649
00:38:00,638 --> 00:38:02,306
And we opened the file,
but the file was missing.

650
00:38:02,331 --> 00:38:03,473
Someone had deleted it.

651
00:38:03,498 --> 00:38:05,974
You planted intelligence on an FBI server.

652
00:38:05,999 --> 00:38:07,729
You need a log-in.

653
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:11,720
You used mine.

654
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,285
No, please. Michelle.

655
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:16,699
Back, back!

656
00:38:16,741 --> 00:38:18,740
This whole time, that's
what this was about.

657
00:38:18,765 --> 00:38:20,765
You got close to me so you can use me!

658
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:23,145
No, no. No, this is real.

659
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:24,975
Everything about you is real to me.

660
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,363
You don't know anything about me.

661
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:27,388
I do.

662
00:38:27,827 --> 00:38:31,434
I know that... how your hair falls in front
of your face like now, but you never move it,

663
00:38:31,459 --> 00:38:32,696
because you'll only have to move it again.

664
00:38:32,721 --> 00:38:34,784
I know that you blow on
your coffee three times

665
00:38:34,809 --> 00:38:36,272
before you take your first sip.

666
00:38:36,297 --> 00:38:38,591
I know that you crinkle
your nose when someone

667
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:39,440
pays you a compliment.

668
00:38:39,465 --> 00:38:45,216
I know that when you kiss your tattoo to remember
your sister, you blink twice to hold back the tears.

669
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:48,798
I'm not lying.

670
00:38:52,101 --> 00:38:53,785
You have to turn yourself in.

671
00:38:53,809 --> 00:38:55,808
- To who?
- I don't know who to trust.

672
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,942
- And I should trust you?
- Yes.

673
00:38:58,123 --> 00:38:59,973
Yes.

674
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:01,887
And I need your help.

675
00:39:01,912 --> 00:39:03,653
I need you to log in to the server.

676
00:39:03,678 --> 00:39:05,678
I need to find out who logged in last.

677
00:39:05,703 --> 00:39:07,582
You're out of your mind.

678
00:39:10,077 --> 00:39:12,077
Show me the picture.

679
00:39:12,366 --> 00:39:14,366
- What?
- The picture of the operative.

680
00:39:14,391 --> 00:39:15,816
You said you have a
picture of him from Italy.

681
00:39:15,841 --> 00:39:16,841
Prove it to me.

682
00:39:16,866 --> 00:39:18,768
Give me something I can
verify, and I'll help.

683
00:39:18,793 --> 00:39:20,793
I'm not carrying it around with me.

684
00:39:20,818 --> 00:39:22,650
I need an hour.

685
00:39:27,069 --> 00:39:29,069
Hurry.

686
00:39:39,736 --> 00:39:41,691
We need to talk.

687
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,679
Natalie planted the request for
assistance from Rome's police.

688
00:39:49,704 --> 00:39:51,409
A man wanted for two open homicides.

689
00:39:51,434 --> 00:39:55,257
And an alert has gone out to
all New York City officers,

690
00:39:55,282 --> 00:39:58,730
and we're going to monitor
the police band for any hits.

691
00:39:58,755 --> 00:40:00,049
In the meantime, we're searching

692
00:40:00,074 --> 00:40:01,521
every traffic camera in a ten-block radius

693
00:40:01,546 --> 00:40:04,641
of Grand Central, so we
are going to find him.

694
00:40:10,233 --> 00:40:14,233
- It's work. I have to...
- Is everything okay?

695
00:40:16,733 --> 00:40:18,733
Everything's going to be fine.

696
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,280
I love you guys.

697
00:40:40,139 --> 00:40:41,139
You be careful.

698
00:40:41,164 --> 00:40:43,164
We're still not really
sure what the mole knows.

699
00:40:43,189 --> 00:40:44,445
Okay, you be very careful.

700
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:45,470
I will.

701
00:41:35,155 --> 00:41:37,155
Don't.

702
00:41:39,193 --> 00:41:41,143
Don't...

703
