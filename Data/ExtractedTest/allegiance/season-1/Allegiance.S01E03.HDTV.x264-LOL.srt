1
00:00:01,638 --> 00:00:05,073
<i>- Previously on Allegiance.
- You turn your son into a spy.</i>

2
00:00:05,098 --> 00:00:07,906
<i>An SVR officer said he was
close to launching an operation</i>

3
00:00:07,931 --> 00:00:09,415
that would bring America to its knees.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,775
They're calling it Black Dagger.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,016
D.C. is setting up a joint
task force to stop it.

6
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:14,574
The best plan we have to stop it

7
00:00:14,604 --> 00:00:16,414
is to find the SVR files Mikhail stole.

8
00:00:16,439 --> 00:00:17,955
This is Alex O'Connor,

9
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,021
but out in the world he's
an alias as Bill Adams.

10
00:00:20,057 --> 00:00:21,427
Michelle Prado.

11
00:00:22,154 --> 00:00:23,920
Tell me the truth, or tell the FBI.

12
00:00:23,971 --> 00:00:25,295
I was having an affair.

13
00:00:25,349 --> 00:00:27,858
Duplicates of the shirts Alex bought.

14
00:00:27,882 --> 00:00:30,380
One button on each is a recorder
with a burst transmitter.

15
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:31,380
Where are the files now?

16
00:00:31,413 --> 00:00:32,715
They're held in an encrypted hard drive

17
00:00:32,748 --> 00:00:35,615
secured inside a laptop. I
uploaded a virus onto the laptop

18
00:00:35,643 --> 00:00:37,340
that will auto-delete the files.

19
00:00:37,387 --> 00:00:39,471
- How long?
- 48 hours.

20
00:00:43,245 --> 00:00:45,281
Got to hold them off for
three or four minutes tops.

21
00:00:49,191 --> 00:00:51,003
_

22
00:00:51,031 --> 00:00:52,330
_

23
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:57,908
10-13, 10-13.

24
00:00:57,933 --> 00:00:59,316
Multiple shots fired.

25
00:00:59,341 --> 00:01:01,650
Federal agent needs
help. Brooklyn Navy Yard.

26
00:01:05,288 --> 00:01:07,923
He was going to kill Alex.

27
00:01:07,957 --> 00:01:10,392
Katya, let's go.

28
00:01:10,426 --> 00:01:12,794
What are you doing?

29
00:01:12,829 --> 00:01:14,429
Come on. I'm buying us another week

30
00:01:14,464 --> 00:01:17,099
before they realize they
have the wrong weapon.

31
00:01:23,421 --> 00:01:25,491
_

32
00:01:25,539 --> 00:01:28,538
Put your finger in the wound.
You have to stop the bleeding.

33
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:30,139
_

34
00:01:31,303 --> 00:01:32,303
_

35
00:01:40,022 --> 00:01:41,286
The password, Vasso.

36
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:43,224
We need the password to the laptop.

37
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:55,648
They're setting up a perimeter.

38
00:01:55,673 --> 00:01:57,874
We need to get outside of it.

39
00:02:11,252 --> 00:02:14,872
88-24. Perimeter set at Concord and the BQE.

40
00:02:14,897 --> 00:02:16,464
Copy that.

41
00:02:16,918 --> 00:02:19,059
33-40, let's get you reposted.

42
00:02:19,084 --> 00:02:20,520
South End, the BQE.

43
00:02:23,254 --> 00:02:25,154
One down. Gunshot wound to the chest.

44
00:02:25,179 --> 00:02:26,644
Multiple perps still in the area.

45
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:28,467
Copy that! Moving in now!

46
00:02:28,492 --> 00:02:30,059
Just remember,

47
00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:32,669
48 hours.

48
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,626
- 48 hours.
- Hey. Hey. Hey!

49
00:02:35,774 --> 00:02:38,176
Hang on! The ambulance is almost here!

50
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:39,365
Alex.

51
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,021
- Alex.
- Come on!

52
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,294
Alex.

53
00:02:44,984 --> 00:02:46,540
He's gone.

54
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:02,991
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

55
00:03:24,497 --> 00:03:26,137
- Hello.
- What the hell are you doing

56
00:03:26,162 --> 00:03:28,331
in the middle of a crime scene?

57
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:30,141
Are you here?

58
00:03:31,032 --> 00:03:33,875
No. You know why, Bill Adams?

59
00:03:34,118 --> 00:03:36,514
- No.
- Because the CIA encourages

60
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:38,273
its undercover officers

61
00:03:38,308 --> 00:03:41,143
to avoid places filled with
reporters and news cameras.

62
00:03:41,177 --> 00:03:43,365
We leave that to our friends at the FBI.

63
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,566
Right.

64
00:03:44,646 --> 00:03:45,980
Get the hell out of there.

65
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,869
There, all done.

66
00:03:53,894 --> 00:03:55,194
Not so bad, was it?

67
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,838
Last time she screamed her head off.

68
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:00,306
Can we get you to do her
booster in three months?

69
00:04:00,331 --> 00:04:02,432
Oh, I only practice one day a week now.

70
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:04,049
Oh, what do you do the rest of the time?

71
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:06,561
Take care of my family.

72
00:04:18,452 --> 00:04:20,453
Hi.

73
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,239
Are you okay? You look exhausted.

74
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:26,831
I pulled an all-nighter for work.

75
00:04:28,457 --> 00:04:30,284
Did Mikhail ever confide in you

76
00:04:30,309 --> 00:04:32,070
or ask you to keep anything secret?

77
00:04:32,962 --> 00:04:34,738
No, just his real name.

78
00:04:34,763 --> 00:04:37,644
He never introduced you to any
colleagues or friends? No one?

79
00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:39,343
No, no. Why?

80
00:04:42,231 --> 00:04:44,533
Mikhail was executed to
prevent him from defecting

81
00:04:44,558 --> 00:04:46,244
with information about a plot against us.

82
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:49,523
Last night a colleague of his
was killed for the same reason.

83
00:04:53,136 --> 00:04:55,309
_

84
00:04:57,401 --> 00:04:58,791
_

85
00:05:02,825 --> 00:05:04,505
I washed my hands three times.

86
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,956
Blood doesn't come off easily. It stains.

87
00:05:08,237 --> 00:05:09,991
I'm a doctor.

88
00:05:14,537 --> 00:05:17,537
- I love you, Alex.
- You too.

89
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,541
Okay.

90
00:05:33,923 --> 00:05:35,632
Hey, Alex.

91
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:37,771
I found something in the web history

92
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,563
of Mikhail's Anatoly Motinkin alias.

93
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:41,689
- What's that?
- About a month ago,

94
00:05:41,714 --> 00:05:42,981
when we believe Mikhail was searching

95
00:05:43,006 --> 00:05:44,078
for a place to hide the egg,

96
00:05:44,103 --> 00:05:46,738
Anatoly Motinkin joined a dating
site for older divorced people.

97
00:05:47,432 --> 00:05:49,914
- Okay.
- Well, the one time

98
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:52,823
he visited the site, he viewed
97 profiles in 12 minutes.

99
00:05:52,848 --> 00:05:56,155
Then he contacted one woman:
The last profile he viewed.

100
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,483
She's a human resources employee at McGregor-Aldrich,

101
00:05:58,507 --> 00:05:59,781
the construction company.

102
00:06:00,835 --> 00:06:02,669
Even if you're right
and Mikhail hid the egg

103
00:06:02,694 --> 00:06:04,862
at one of McGregor's job sites,
they probably have a hundred...

104
00:06:04,887 --> 00:06:07,389
217 on the East Coast.

105
00:06:07,739 --> 00:06:09,740
I'm assuming Mikhail
wouldn't have wanted to fly,

106
00:06:09,765 --> 00:06:11,599
given all the security cameras at airports.

107
00:06:12,895 --> 00:06:16,398
Alex, how are you doing?

108
00:06:17,467 --> 00:06:19,099
What do you mean?

109
00:06:19,124 --> 00:06:20,659
Watching someone die,

110
00:06:20,684 --> 00:06:23,865
plugging their chest wound
with your index finger...

111
00:06:24,853 --> 00:06:27,165
That's not in the analyst job description.

112
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:29,954
We need to find his laptop.

113
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:32,266
I need to find it.

114
00:06:34,414 --> 00:06:36,481
Okay.

115
00:06:50,934 --> 00:06:52,865
<i>You know the office alarm
rings in the rezidentura.</i>

116
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,624
- I disabled it.
- Are you sure?

117
00:06:55,733 --> 00:06:57,356
Depends on how good the training I got

118
00:06:57,381 --> 00:06:58,835
from your colleagues was.

119
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,799
My brother was almost killed last night.

120
00:07:03,196 --> 00:07:06,663
Do you really think the
SVR wants to kill Alex?

121
00:07:07,016 --> 00:07:08,438
He's an important source for them.

122
00:07:08,463 --> 00:07:09,830
Then why did they send in a hit team?

123
00:07:09,855 --> 00:07:11,347
It was a capture team for Vasso.

124
00:07:11,372 --> 00:07:12,878
- With a sniper?
- In case Vasso

125
00:07:12,903 --> 00:07:14,577
couldn't be taken alive.

126
00:07:16,676 --> 00:07:19,377
If anything happens to
him, I'm blaming you.

127
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:24,830
Do you have any idea how much I've done

128
00:07:24,855 --> 00:07:26,191
to protect Alex?

129
00:07:26,885 --> 00:07:28,284
To protect the rest of your family?

130
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:31,612
Right. Because you care about them so much.

131
00:07:31,637 --> 00:07:33,197
Because of you.

132
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,597
Why can't I stay away from you?

133
00:07:47,725 --> 00:07:49,397
Can I help you?

134
00:07:49,501 --> 00:07:51,002
I'd like some samples.

135
00:07:51,027 --> 00:07:53,296
Sure. Which ones?

136
00:07:55,763 --> 00:07:57,354
All of them.

137
00:08:10,883 --> 00:08:13,236
Just stay on this side of the glass.

138
00:08:18,087 --> 00:08:20,182
I need to go back to Mikhail's apartment.

139
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,324
Okay.

140
00:08:38,007 --> 00:08:40,142
Okay, you gonna tell me why
we came all the way over here?

141
00:08:40,176 --> 00:08:42,277
Philadelphia City Hall.

142
00:08:42,312 --> 00:08:44,213
- What?
- The egg.

143
00:08:44,247 --> 00:08:45,810
The laptop with the SVR files.

144
00:08:45,835 --> 00:08:47,836
Mikhail hid it in Philadelphia City Hall.

145
00:08:53,483 --> 00:08:55,949
I concluded Mikhail sought
out McGregor-Aldrich ID

146
00:08:55,974 --> 00:08:57,525
to hide the egg at one of their job sites.

147
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,330
Next, I needed to determine the exact scent

148
00:08:59,355 --> 00:09:01,474
of cut stone I smelled in
his closet on Wednesday.

149
00:09:01,817 --> 00:09:05,436
I found it with this:
Pennsylvania bluestone.

150
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,729
It was only used at one McGregor
job site in the last month:

151
00:09:07,763 --> 00:09:09,725
A renovation of Philadelphia City Hall.

152
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,442
Bluestone was used exclusively

153
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:14,102
to renovate a ceremonial
room called Conversation Hall.

154
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:17,026
The original city charter
from 1682 is displayed here,

155
00:09:17,051 --> 00:09:19,118
along with this historic vault.

156
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:20,761
And you think he posed as a workman

157
00:09:20,786 --> 00:09:22,760
to hide the hard drive
we're after in that safe?

158
00:09:23,107 --> 00:09:25,342
A safe that's not in use is never opened

159
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:27,303
inside of an alarmed
room, inside of a building

160
00:09:27,328 --> 00:09:29,501
with airport-style security at its entrance.

161
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:36,376
Well, it's secure and
just about the last place

162
00:09:36,401 --> 00:09:38,769
the SVR would think he'd
hide their stolen files.

163
00:09:38,794 --> 00:09:40,494
It's also a place he'd be familiar with,

164
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:42,520
since his first U.S. posting was to Philly.

165
00:09:42,731 --> 00:09:44,265
It's worth a look.

166
00:09:44,299 --> 00:09:47,201
All right, call the
U.S. attorney in Philly.

167
00:09:47,226 --> 00:09:48,960
Let's get a search
warrant for a government...

168
00:09:48,985 --> 00:09:50,826
No, Sir. I'm not sure we should do that.

169
00:09:51,252 --> 00:09:52,626
Um...

170
00:09:53,786 --> 00:09:55,652
If we get our hands on those files

171
00:09:55,677 --> 00:09:57,356
and the SVR find out about it,

172
00:09:57,381 --> 00:09:59,754
they'll adapt to protect
their assets and operations.

173
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:02,956
Those files will become
almost worthless to us.

174
00:10:03,848 --> 00:10:06,697
I propose that we obtain authorization

175
00:10:06,722 --> 00:10:09,123
to surreptitiously enter Conversation Hall,

176
00:10:09,157 --> 00:10:10,591
retrieve Mikhail's laptop,

177
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,628
and then place another
laptop inside the vault

178
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:15,027
containing SVR documents of
a low classification level.

179
00:10:15,305 --> 00:10:17,606
When the SVR recover the fake laptop,

180
00:10:17,631 --> 00:10:19,571
they'll conclude they never
suffered the massive breach

181
00:10:19,596 --> 00:10:21,645
they now think they have, and
won't change their behavior.

182
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,334
Meanwhile, we'll be able to watch them,

183
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:26,133
and we'll learn what we need to,
to foil their plans to harm us.

184
00:10:26,966 --> 00:10:28,700
Do you have any idea how big a deal it is

185
00:10:28,725 --> 00:10:30,921
to get the directors of the CIA, the FBI,

186
00:10:30,946 --> 00:10:33,239
the Attorney General, and
ultimately a Fisa judge

187
00:10:33,264 --> 00:10:35,450
to legally authorize the secret break-in

188
00:10:35,475 --> 00:10:37,092
to the seat of government of a U.S. city?

189
00:10:37,117 --> 00:10:38,591
Especially over the weekend.

190
00:10:39,824 --> 00:10:41,361
You're crazy.

191
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,509
Two days ago, you were lecturing us

192
00:10:43,534 --> 00:10:45,510
that there was no time to put surveillance

193
00:10:45,535 --> 00:10:48,404
on Mikhail's apartment with
the specter of an SVR attack

194
00:10:48,429 --> 00:10:49,413
looming over us.

195
00:10:49,438 --> 00:10:50,491
And today, suddenly,

196
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:52,611
the government doesn't work weekends, Bill?

197
00:10:52,711 --> 00:10:55,445
That laptop auto-deletes in 36 hours.

198
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,070
And every hour from now until then

199
00:10:57,095 --> 00:10:59,126
is another hour that the
Russians could beat us to it.

200
00:10:59,151 --> 00:11:00,767
If we want to stop that attack,

201
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:03,532
we have to move fast and get those files

202
00:11:03,557 --> 00:11:04,932
before they're gone forever.

203
00:11:10,048 --> 00:11:12,233
That was awesome. You were awesome.

204
00:11:12,258 --> 00:11:14,765
Don't get ahead of yourself.
We don't have approval yet, kid.

205
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:18,878
Go back to your hotel and pack.
We're on the 6 P.M. acela to DC.

206
00:11:20,663 --> 00:11:23,064
Conversation Hall,
retrieve Mikhail's laptop,

207
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,933
and then place another
laptop inside the vault

208
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:27,535
containing SVR documents of
a low classification level.

209
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,106
_

210
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,854
We need to get into that
vault before the FBI does.

211
00:11:38,014 --> 00:11:39,914
Are we bringing a team in from Moscow?

212
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,025
It would take a month to
build covers deep enough

213
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,274
to get six new faces
with thick Russian accents

214
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:46,536
into the building without
arousing any suspicion.

215
00:11:46,716 --> 00:11:48,750
So, what do we do?

216
00:11:48,815 --> 00:11:50,798
_

217
00:11:52,361 --> 00:11:54,062
- You can't be serious.
- I don't like it

218
00:11:54,096 --> 00:11:55,563
any more than you do.

219
00:11:55,598 --> 00:11:57,589
I'd much rather have
professionals handle it.

220
00:11:57,614 --> 00:11:59,022
What's that supposed to mean?

221
00:11:59,047 --> 00:12:02,026
_

222
00:12:05,251 --> 00:12:07,285
Blueprints for City Hall.

223
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,819
Throwaway identities for
both of you and Natalie.

224
00:12:11,176 --> 00:12:13,500
- Hotel reservations.
- We're gonna need entry codes,

225
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:16,383
overrides, real-time monitoring
of Philly PD dispatch,

226
00:12:16,408 --> 00:12:18,682
not to mention a few very
specialized pieces of equipment.

227
00:12:18,707 --> 00:12:21,081
Make a list by midnight.

228
00:12:31,772 --> 00:12:33,239
We should have fought him harder.

229
00:12:33,264 --> 00:12:35,348
- You mean I should have.
- No! No, I mean...

230
00:12:35,373 --> 00:12:37,653
With what leverage,
Katya? We don't have any.

231
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:40,185
Do you want to talk more
about what I said to Alex?

232
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,245
- About the affair?
- No, I don't.

233
00:12:43,106 --> 00:12:44,542
You already told me nothing happened.

234
00:12:44,567 --> 00:12:45,817
Right. You just... you don't seem to...

235
00:12:45,843 --> 00:12:48,317
why don't we just focus
on getting Mikhail's laptop

236
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,520
so our son doesn't discover
who we really are and disown us.

237
00:12:52,761 --> 00:12:54,614
And we don't end up in some federal prison

238
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,426
for the rest of our lives,

239
00:12:55,451 --> 00:12:57,526
or end up in a furnace like Mikhail.

240
00:12:59,254 --> 00:13:01,488
Even if we pull this
off, it won't end there.

241
00:13:01,513 --> 00:13:03,114
We have to figure out a way out.

242
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:05,374
We have to find a way
to get our lives back.

243
00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:13,109
- What if this was our way out?
- What do you mean?

244
00:13:15,844 --> 00:13:18,116
Philadelphia City Hall.
The largest in the world.

245
00:13:18,141 --> 00:13:20,584
Houses the mayor, the City Council, Courts.

246
00:13:20,609 --> 00:13:21,938
One public entrance,

247
00:13:21,963 --> 00:13:23,724
which we definitely
don't want to go through.

248
00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:25,653
Employee and service
entrances aren't much better.

249
00:13:25,678 --> 00:13:27,754
Card readers, security cameras everywhere.

250
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:30,754
Well, how do we get in there
without being caught on tape?

251
00:13:31,763 --> 00:13:33,453
Across the street from City Hall:

252
00:13:33,478 --> 00:13:36,123
The largest Freemasons temple in the U.S.

253
00:13:36,246 --> 00:13:39,384
City Hall was designed
and built by the Masons,

254
00:13:39,409 --> 00:13:41,066
and apparently they built a secret tunnel

255
00:13:41,091 --> 00:13:42,566
that connects it to their temple.

256
00:13:42,591 --> 00:13:45,814
- How do we it's really there?
- It's on the blueprint.

257
00:13:48,138 --> 00:13:49,739
We have to get through
some metal bars here.

258
00:13:49,764 --> 00:13:51,866
But with the right
equipment, that's doable.

259
00:13:52,796 --> 00:13:54,397
We send Natalie ahead to scout for us.

260
00:13:54,422 --> 00:13:56,190
She can bring Sarah with her.

261
00:13:56,215 --> 00:13:59,117
- What?
- Nothing. Just...

262
00:14:00,124 --> 00:14:01,614
I love you.

263
00:14:03,244 --> 00:14:04,834
I know you do.

264
00:14:07,075 --> 00:14:09,713
We break into the temple at night.

265
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:13,108
We go through the tunnel to get
to the basement of City Hall.

266
00:14:13,133 --> 00:14:14,526
There's a staircase they used to use

267
00:14:14,551 --> 00:14:16,236
to transport prisoners
from their holding cells

268
00:14:16,261 --> 00:14:18,252
in the basement up to a
courtroom on each floor.

269
00:14:18,277 --> 00:14:20,052
Once we get into this courtroom here,

270
00:14:20,077 --> 00:14:21,705
we can use internal doors

271
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,847
to move from one courtroom
to the next without ever

272
00:14:23,872 --> 00:14:25,081
setting foot in the hallway,

273
00:14:25,106 --> 00:14:27,230
where there are security desks and cameras.

274
00:14:29,362 --> 00:14:32,162
We'll end up here, just a
few steps away from the doors

275
00:14:32,187 --> 00:14:33,199
to Conversation Hall,

276
00:14:33,224 --> 00:14:34,958
just around the corner
from this guard's desk.

277
00:14:34,983 --> 00:14:36,428
But he'll have no line of sight to us,

278
00:14:36,453 --> 00:14:38,949
so if we're quiet, we should be safe.

279
00:14:38,974 --> 00:14:40,708
- Mm-hmm.
- We go through the doors

280
00:14:40,733 --> 00:14:41,966
to Conversation Hall,

281
00:14:41,991 --> 00:14:43,224
get to the vault.

282
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,016
Inside the vault is the laptop.

283
00:14:46,734 --> 00:14:48,668
The anniversary of the
founding of the city is Sunday.

284
00:14:48,693 --> 00:14:50,594
The mayor's giving a speech
at City Hall during the day,

285
00:14:50,619 --> 00:14:51,526
so that's out.

286
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:54,526
We aim for Sunday night.

287
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,686
It's a brilliant plan,

288
00:14:56,711 --> 00:14:59,785
but you do realize it
will be next to impossible.

289
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:02,831
It's the only chance we got.

290
00:15:04,108 --> 00:15:06,372
Now arriving 30th street, Philadelphia.

291
00:15:06,437 --> 00:15:08,371
If this is your stop, check your seat

292
00:15:08,396 --> 00:15:12,272
and overhead luggage racks for
any and all personal belongings.

293
00:15:16,976 --> 00:15:18,405
_

294
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,383
Combined with the fact
that Pennsylvania bluestone

295
00:15:20,408 --> 00:15:22,172
is so rare today, I have
a high degree of confidence

296
00:15:22,197 --> 00:15:24,232
that the laptop containing
these critical SVR files

297
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,758
was hidden by colonel Mikhail Vostrov

298
00:15:25,783 --> 00:15:27,221
in Philadelphia City Hall.

299
00:15:27,246 --> 00:15:28,747
This what you meant when you said

300
00:15:28,772 --> 00:15:30,500
you were training the
analysts in Russia house

301
00:15:30,525 --> 00:15:32,293
to think outside the box, Don?

302
00:15:32,318 --> 00:15:34,653
Not my training. He came to me this way.

303
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,476
But Russia's been acting
pretty far outside the box

304
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,795
for the last year, so
maybe it was lucky timing.

305
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,124
Any more on the plot

306
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:41,649
that drove Mikhail to steal these files?

307
00:15:41,848 --> 00:15:43,316
We don't know details.

308
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:45,746
All we know is that the
SVR was willing to kill

309
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:46,917
three of its own officers

310
00:15:46,942 --> 00:15:48,214
to protect whatever this operation is.

311
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,973
If we want to know what
the Russians are planning,

312
00:15:49,998 --> 00:15:51,314
we need to find that laptop.

313
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:53,306
Oh, I realize that, Mr. O'Connor.

314
00:15:53,331 --> 00:15:56,981
I just wish I wasn't relying on
your sense of smell to find it.

315
00:15:57,006 --> 00:15:58,925
Sir, you won't need to do that anymore.

316
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:03,438
S&T just did spectral analysis
on the dust on Mikhail's jacket.

317
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,735
They confirmed it's Pennsylvania bluestone.

318
00:16:12,724 --> 00:16:14,861
You're batting a thousand so far.

319
00:16:16,937 --> 00:16:18,953
So does this smooth the
way with the FBI director?

320
00:16:19,316 --> 00:16:20,437
Not really.

321
00:16:20,462 --> 00:16:22,917
The Bureau bears all the
risk if this goes south.

322
00:16:23,137 --> 00:16:26,006
Surreptitious entry on U.S.
soil involving U.S. citizens?

323
00:16:26,031 --> 00:16:27,498
CIA can't touch those.

324
00:16:27,713 --> 00:16:29,247
It's the FBI's show top to bottom.

325
00:16:29,272 --> 00:16:31,473
Only reason the Agency
has to sign off at all

326
00:16:31,498 --> 00:16:32,872
is we still pay your checks.

327
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,842
Oh, and it won't be us
tomorrow with the FBI director.

328
00:16:35,867 --> 00:16:38,242
I can't help you there. But Michelle can.

329
00:16:38,267 --> 00:16:39,742
She'll Shepherd you through that meeting.

330
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:42,266
- Okay.
- However good the reason is,

331
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,593
the optics of a rookie CIA analyst,

332
00:16:44,618 --> 00:16:46,314
even one detailed to the Bureau,

333
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,640
proposing that the FBI
break into the City Hall

334
00:16:48,665 --> 00:16:51,434
of a major U.S. city, are not... Ideal.

335
00:16:51,787 --> 00:16:54,629
So try to get in sync with Michelle

336
00:16:54,654 --> 00:16:56,484
- before you walk in there.
- Sure, sure.

337
00:16:57,698 --> 00:16:59,184
How do I do that?

338
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:02,184
Talk to her about it.

339
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:03,984
She doesn't like talking to me.

340
00:17:04,009 --> 00:17:06,383
I don't think she likes me very much.

341
00:17:06,408 --> 00:17:07,883
She makes everyone feel like that.

342
00:17:07,908 --> 00:17:11,310
You just have to cultivate
a relationship with her.

343
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:14,484
Well, how do I do that?

344
00:17:15,147 --> 00:17:16,470
Have a beer with her.

345
00:17:16,495 --> 00:17:19,113
Just don't take her to a dive bar

346
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:21,539
or any place where some drunk
guy might try to grab her butt.

347
00:17:21,564 --> 00:17:22,797
Won't end well for them.

348
00:17:22,822 --> 00:17:24,289
And don't...

349
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,466
Do not get into a game
of quarters with her.

350
00:17:27,632 --> 00:17:29,666
That won't end well for you.

351
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:33,284
Quarters?

352
00:17:34,623 --> 00:17:36,318
_

353
00:17:45,004 --> 00:17:47,005
Adrian!

354
00:17:48,495 --> 00:17:49,862
What?

355
00:17:50,157 --> 00:17:52,371
You gotta do that when you come here.

356
00:17:52,849 --> 00:17:54,835
<i>I mean, who doesn't love Rocky?</i>

357
00:17:55,078 --> 00:17:57,013
<i>What's Rocky?</i>

358
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,035
Heathen.

359
00:18:00,691 --> 00:18:02,736
I don't know what that means either.

360
00:18:03,233 --> 00:18:05,736
Thanks for rescuing me from
that lame school trip to Albany.

361
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,738
Just pray mom doesn't find out

362
00:18:08,763 --> 00:18:10,551
I forged her signature
to get you out of it.

363
00:18:10,575 --> 00:18:13,667
So how long's your nerd
conference on Sunday?

364
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:15,081
Maybe four hours.

365
00:18:15,106 --> 00:18:17,580
Bet you'll still be sleeping
by the time I get in.

366
00:18:18,878 --> 00:18:20,512
Here.

367
00:18:20,571 --> 00:18:21,872
Some church?

368
00:18:21,897 --> 00:18:23,531
It's a masonic temple.

369
00:18:23,556 --> 00:18:26,058
Church, temple. Same thing.

370
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,817
Haven't you heard of the Masons?

371
00:18:27,842 --> 00:18:30,122
It's like a cool secret society.

372
00:18:30,493 --> 00:18:32,027
Well, if it's so secret,

373
00:18:32,052 --> 00:18:34,754
then why do they give public tours?

374
00:18:39,595 --> 00:18:42,898
You are aware the free
people boutique at Macy's

375
00:18:42,923 --> 00:18:44,642
is having a sale?

376
00:18:44,811 --> 00:18:47,942
Could you just give me
a few minutes, please?

377
00:18:49,533 --> 00:18:51,541
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Yeah?

378
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:53,631
You asked earlier about a hidden tunnel

379
00:18:53,656 --> 00:18:56,022
going to City Hall?
Before it was sealed off,

380
00:18:56,047 --> 00:18:58,686
the hidden door to that
tunnel was in the next room.

381
00:18:58,711 --> 00:19:01,122
Really? Could we see that?

382
00:19:03,757 --> 00:19:06,726
Hey. I was wondering if
you wanted to get a beer.

383
00:19:08,463 --> 00:19:11,322
- I'll have a Potomac Ale.
- Sir?

384
00:19:12,483 --> 00:19:15,151
Oh, I don't drink beer. Water.

385
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:20,392
What did you want to meet about?

386
00:19:20,417 --> 00:19:22,452
Sam said I should cultivate
a relationship with you.

387
00:19:22,964 --> 00:19:24,822
Really?

388
00:19:26,783 --> 00:19:29,022
He suggest you take me here?

389
00:19:29,058 --> 00:19:31,393
He said I shouldn't take you to a dive bar.

390
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,246
What other advice did he give you?

391
00:19:35,686 --> 00:19:37,654
Let you take the lead in
the bureau meeting tomorrow.

392
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,346
He was adamant about that.

393
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,763
Oh, and not to get into a
game of quarters with you.

394
00:19:41,788 --> 00:19:43,789
But I don't know what that means.

395
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:48,709
I think I'm gonna puke.

396
00:19:48,734 --> 00:19:50,535
Do you not eat ice cream at home?

397
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,646
That would require leaving my room

398
00:19:52,671 --> 00:19:54,446
and venturing out into the danger zone.

399
00:19:54,471 --> 00:19:57,067
Seriously, was mom as
psychotic about you getting as

400
00:19:57,092 --> 00:19:58,267
as she is with me?

401
00:19:58,292 --> 00:20:00,336
It's like the only thing she cares about.

402
00:20:00,361 --> 00:20:02,727
Oh, that's not fair. She
just wants to you have

403
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:04,826
the best opportunities
you can have in life.

404
00:20:05,651 --> 00:20:07,526
She'd do anything for you.

405
00:20:08,242 --> 00:20:09,925
For any of us.

406
00:20:15,372 --> 00:20:16,494
What's that?

407
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:18,729
- _
- My work phone.

408
00:20:19,268 --> 00:20:21,885
I'm gonna go downstairs
and get us some candy

409
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:22,808
while I call them,

410
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,901
and you're gonna eat it when I get back.

411
00:20:24,926 --> 00:20:26,606
Okay.

412
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:39,699
We have a problem.

413
00:20:43,877 --> 00:20:45,251
We can't wait until tomorrow night.

414
00:20:45,276 --> 00:20:47,331
The government is moving
much faster on Alex's theory

415
00:20:47,356 --> 00:20:49,288
than we expected. Also, the battery

416
00:20:49,313 --> 00:20:50,312
in his button mic has died,

417
00:20:50,337 --> 00:20:51,760
so there will be no further updates.

418
00:20:51,872 --> 00:20:53,831
We have to assume that the FBI will be here

419
00:20:53,856 --> 00:20:54,889
as early as tomorrow morning.

420
00:20:55,312 --> 00:20:57,535
So are we going tonight?

421
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,453
- We haven't even...
- No, we can't go tonight.

422
00:20:59,478 --> 00:21:01,155
We don't have the autodialer for the vault.

423
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,533
It will all be here at 6 A.M.

424
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:04,025
But that's not night anymore, is it now?

425
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,361
You're saying we do it tomorrow day,

426
00:21:05,386 --> 00:21:07,688
- on the city's anniversary?
- Yes, that's what he's saying.

427
00:21:07,713 --> 00:21:10,061
The mayor is giving a speech
40 feet away from the room

428
00:21:10,085 --> 00:21:11,943
you're breaking into.
The place will be crawling

429
00:21:11,968 --> 00:21:13,469
with cops, not to mention
flooded with daylight.

430
00:21:13,494 --> 00:21:14,728
The plan still works.

431
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,760
There are new obstacles, yes.

432
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:18,787
Are you crazy?

433
00:21:18,848 --> 00:21:21,696
I mean, are you all crazy?
We're gonna get caught.

434
00:21:21,721 --> 00:21:24,711
If Alex beats you to that
laptop, you'll all be dead.

435
00:21:28,091 --> 00:21:30,080
All of us will be.

436
00:21:31,409 --> 00:21:33,412
We go at 6 A.M.

437
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,300
I'm sorry.

438
00:21:37,686 --> 00:21:40,011
I'll be back as soon as it arrives.

439
00:21:40,553 --> 00:21:42,412
Son of a bitch.

440
00:21:44,591 --> 00:21:46,912
I need a cigarette.

441
00:21:46,937 --> 00:21:48,711
Come on.

442
00:21:54,866 --> 00:21:57,668
Since when did you start
smoking, Dr. O'Connor?

443
00:21:57,693 --> 00:21:58,912
I didn't.

444
00:21:59,348 --> 00:22:01,852
But the SVR provided all
that equipment down there,

445
00:22:01,874 --> 00:22:03,585
and I guarantee you the room is miked.

446
00:22:03,816 --> 00:22:06,286
I don't care if Victor
knows what I think of him.

447
00:22:06,932 --> 00:22:09,000
You might not need one,
but I sure as hell do.

448
00:22:09,724 --> 00:22:12,065
What the... what's wrong with you?

449
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,765
What's wrong with you?

450
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:15,565
You're with him!

451
00:22:17,678 --> 00:22:20,045
I knew that you were back then.

452
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,603
But it ended. You told me it ended.

453
00:22:22,628 --> 00:22:24,459
- It did. It just...
- And you choose now

454
00:22:24,484 --> 00:22:26,218
to start it back up again? Now?

455
00:22:27,622 --> 00:22:29,659
_

456
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:30,762
_

457
00:22:30,787 --> 00:22:32,500
_

458
00:22:32,577 --> 00:22:33,976
_

459
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,860
I'm not. I just...

460
00:22:36,885 --> 00:22:38,524
Just what?

461
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:43,491
I don't know. I can't help it.

462
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:48,323
I know it hasn't been easy

463
00:22:49,122 --> 00:22:50,424
being my daughter.

464
00:22:50,831 --> 00:22:52,837
And maybe you hate me for all my mistakes,

465
00:22:52,862 --> 00:22:54,863
and this is how you're making me pay.

466
00:22:54,888 --> 00:22:56,025
Are you crazy?

467
00:22:56,912 --> 00:22:58,725
I love you. You're my mom.

468
00:22:59,053 --> 00:23:00,053
_

469
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:01,717
You're choosing him over us!

470
00:23:01,742 --> 00:23:04,316
Mama, nyet. I'm not.

471
00:23:09,237 --> 00:23:10,616
I'm sorry.

472
00:23:12,242 --> 00:23:14,217
I didn't ask you up here to fight.

473
00:23:14,722 --> 00:23:16,616
We are going to double-cross Victor tomorrow,

474
00:23:16,641 --> 00:23:18,275
and we need your help to do it.

475
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,443
What? What are you talking about?

476
00:23:20,468 --> 00:23:22,267
We are going to get that laptop tomorrow.

477
00:23:22,979 --> 00:23:25,007
And then, when we're heading
back through that tunnel,

478
00:23:25,032 --> 00:23:27,989
we need your help to make
a copy of the disk drive.

479
00:23:28,014 --> 00:23:29,907
Remotely, from here, using the device

480
00:23:29,932 --> 00:23:32,607
that your father's company
sells to the military.

481
00:23:32,632 --> 00:23:34,792
And then when we hand
that laptop to Victor,

482
00:23:34,817 --> 00:23:38,291
the SVR surveillance ringing
City Hall will disperse.

483
00:23:38,555 --> 00:23:40,392
And then we're gonna take our copy

484
00:23:40,417 --> 00:23:42,752
and we're going to trade it for immunity.

485
00:23:42,777 --> 00:23:45,192
And then we will finally be out.

486
00:23:45,731 --> 00:23:47,291
That's why you had me bring Sarah.

487
00:23:47,615 --> 00:23:49,216
To keep her close.

488
00:23:49,241 --> 00:23:52,404
Yes. The minute you
get confirmation from us

489
00:23:52,429 --> 00:23:54,964
that we have the files, you
get Sarah and you take her

490
00:23:54,989 --> 00:23:56,974
to the federal building
that is six blocks from here.

491
00:23:56,999 --> 00:23:58,673
What if the SVR doesn't disperse?

492
00:23:59,015 --> 00:24:00,615
What if they see us going to the FBI?

493
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,916
They can't.

494
00:24:02,701 --> 00:24:05,815
If we ever want to be out,
if we ever want to be safe,

495
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,043
all of us, including Alex,

496
00:24:09,068 --> 00:24:12,115
this is the only way.

497
00:24:14,146 --> 00:24:16,848
They'll kill Victor if we succeed.

498
00:24:19,211 --> 00:24:21,501
I'm sorry. I am.

499
00:24:23,005 --> 00:24:24,925
But you have a choice to make.

500
00:24:25,152 --> 00:24:27,706
Victor or your family.

501
00:24:48,828 --> 00:24:50,889
All the equipment you requested.

502
00:24:56,998 --> 00:24:58,583
What the hell is this?

503
00:24:58,626 --> 00:25:01,495
The rezident wanted to
discourage any second thoughts.

504
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,011
Are you kidding me?

505
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:04,795
Stop!

506
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:08,047
I'm not doing this to you.

507
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:12,124
If I was, the rezident would
know Sarah's not in Albany.

508
00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:13,531
She's here.

509
00:25:16,461 --> 00:25:19,763
Just do your job today and
everything will be fine.

510
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:24,154
If anything happens to Sarah, I kill you.

511
00:25:45,854 --> 00:25:47,553
I'm sorry.

512
00:25:49,842 --> 00:25:51,753
Me too.

513
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,154
Back alley clear.

514
00:26:01,035 --> 00:26:02,553
Be careful.

515
00:26:29,285 --> 00:26:32,417
Hello?

516
00:26:32,666 --> 00:26:34,211
- Got it.
- Thanks.

517
00:26:38,784 --> 00:26:39,911
Hello?

518
00:26:39,936 --> 00:26:42,336
Director's meeting us at 8
A.M. at the hoover building.

519
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:43,293
Do not be late.

520
00:26:43,318 --> 00:26:44,551
That would be impossible.

521
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,809
What?

522
00:26:47,071 --> 00:26:49,091
I'm already here.

523
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:51,841
It's five past 6:00, you lunatic.

524
00:26:51,866 --> 00:26:53,767
The laptop auto-deletes in 14 hours.

525
00:26:53,792 --> 00:26:55,692
The Russians aren't gonna
wait. We can't either.

526
00:26:57,352 --> 00:26:58,819
We're in.

527
00:26:58,844 --> 00:27:00,245
No alarm.

528
00:27:05,235 --> 00:27:07,329
Egyptian Hall. What's the track?

529
00:27:07,354 --> 00:27:09,322
Don't go out the right-hand
door. There's a camera there.

530
00:27:09,347 --> 00:27:12,316
Left door, cut left hard
when you get through it.

531
00:27:16,793 --> 00:27:18,460
Okay, moving to Oriental hall.

532
00:27:19,566 --> 00:27:21,374
- No cameras.
- Got it.

533
00:27:23,864 --> 00:27:25,940
- Dad?
- Yeah.

534
00:27:26,226 --> 00:27:27,726
Do you remember when I was 15,

535
00:27:27,751 --> 00:27:29,841
you were obsessed with
taking me to the Bronx zoo?

536
00:27:29,866 --> 00:27:31,940
Sure, to see the African penguins.

537
00:27:31,965 --> 00:27:34,640
- Kept putting it off.
- We never did end up going.

538
00:27:36,745 --> 00:27:38,841
I just wanted you to know
that I always regretted that.

539
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:41,241
Well, then it's a date.
Me and you, the Bronx zoo.

540
00:27:41,407 --> 00:27:43,175
Exiting oriental hall.

541
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:46,741
Take a left into a room with
gigantic metal and glass doors.

542
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,128
I'm an engineer, honey.
It... it's impressive.

543
00:27:57,162 --> 00:27:58,741
Come on.

544
00:28:14,224 --> 00:28:15,541
What a tool.

545
00:28:19,626 --> 00:28:20,967
You in the Grand Hallway?

546
00:28:20,992 --> 00:28:22,712
It sure as hell looks like it.

547
00:28:22,737 --> 00:28:24,638
Okay, hard left under the stairway.

548
00:28:24,663 --> 00:28:25,913
Big green doors.

549
00:28:26,426 --> 00:28:27,714
Got it.

550
00:28:33,131 --> 00:28:35,666
Diagonally across the
room, there's a blind arch.

551
00:28:35,701 --> 00:28:37,367
- Beige with tan trim?
- That's the one.

552
00:28:37,392 --> 00:28:38,592
Got it.

553
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:42,467
Who builds something like this?

554
00:28:44,943 --> 00:28:47,211
- Masons.
- Masons.

555
00:29:04,334 --> 00:29:05,967
I can't pick this.

556
00:29:06,899 --> 00:29:09,196
No, we're going to break
it. Freeze it, okay?

557
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,896
- What is it?
- Sarah.

558
00:29:12,378 --> 00:29:13,745
If anything goes wrong...

559
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:16,097
No, look, the plan is solid, Katya.

560
00:29:16,122 --> 00:29:18,390
By the time the SVR figures
out that we played them,

561
00:29:18,415 --> 00:29:19,782
we're gonna be safe. All of us.

562
00:29:19,807 --> 00:29:21,497
Even the best plan...
something can go wrong.

563
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:24,750
We are going to be okay.

564
00:29:24,778 --> 00:29:26,597
You got it?

565
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,337
Freeze it.

566
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:37,482
Got it.

567
00:29:37,896 --> 00:29:39,621
NGI techs just got a hit on Mikhail

568
00:29:39,646 --> 00:29:41,382
off the Philly City Hall footage.

569
00:29:41,501 --> 00:29:43,182
I'm guessing you're ready for this?

570
00:29:45,071 --> 00:29:46,972
Software puts the match at 35%.

571
00:29:47,217 --> 00:29:49,182
It is him. I recognize him.

572
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,449
You recognize him? Like you know him?

573
00:29:52,734 --> 00:29:53,982
You guys pals?

574
00:29:54,102 --> 00:29:56,382
Because that's not an obvious match for me.

575
00:29:56,936 --> 00:29:59,423
- How many other images we got?
- That's it, Sir.

576
00:29:59,448 --> 00:30:01,695
But we've only been through
1/3rd of the footage.

577
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,417
- The building has 96 cameras.
- Well, how long

578
00:30:04,442 --> 00:30:05,876
to get through the rest of the footage

579
00:30:05,901 --> 00:30:07,596
to see if we can make another match?

580
00:30:07,646 --> 00:30:09,660
- 24 hours.
- We don't have 24 hours.

581
00:30:09,685 --> 00:30:11,558
That laptop deletes itself in 11 hours,

582
00:30:11,583 --> 00:30:13,207
and we lose any chance we
have of stopping Black Dagger.

583
00:30:13,232 --> 00:30:14,246
Alex.

584
00:30:25,364 --> 00:30:28,446
Son, I know what happened to
you at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.

585
00:30:28,601 --> 00:30:31,482
And I can understand why
you'd make this thing personal

586
00:30:31,507 --> 00:30:33,475
- after a thing like that.
- I've just seen firsthand

587
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,146
what the SVR is capable of.

588
00:30:37,249 --> 00:30:39,045
What do you think, Agent Prado?

589
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,645
You're closest to the facts on this one.

590
00:30:40,788 --> 00:30:42,912
The SVR murdered three
of their own officers

591
00:30:42,937 --> 00:30:44,487
over these stolen files.

592
00:30:44,512 --> 00:30:46,733
They engaged in a firefight
with a federal agent

593
00:30:46,758 --> 00:30:48,032
on U.S. soil.

594
00:30:48,057 --> 00:30:51,278
In the entire cold war, the
KGB never dared to do that.

595
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,351
Whatever's on that laptop,
I think it's worth the risk.

596
00:30:54,506 --> 00:30:56,651
And if it's not there?

597
00:30:56,689 --> 00:30:59,724
Then it becomes a political
and legal firestorm

598
00:30:59,749 --> 00:31:02,183
with everybody yelling "FBI overreach"

599
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:03,850
and "constitutional crisis"

600
00:31:03,875 --> 00:31:05,350
the moment our entry comes out.

601
00:31:05,677 --> 00:31:06,850
It's there.

602
00:31:07,291 --> 00:31:08,625
So that won't happen.

603
00:31:12,157 --> 00:31:13,551
All right.

604
00:31:13,576 --> 00:31:15,744
Call the Attorney General.

605
00:31:33,541 --> 00:31:35,409
Are you through it yet?

606
00:31:35,882 --> 00:31:38,317
Mayor's arriving for his speech.

607
00:31:38,342 --> 00:31:39,950
He's working on it.

608
00:31:42,991 --> 00:31:44,754
Try again.

609
00:32:03,632 --> 00:32:05,303
- Through the gate.
- Good.

610
00:32:05,328 --> 00:32:07,754
Now you need to move fast... faster than

611
00:32:07,779 --> 00:32:09,420
- you were expecting.
- Why?

612
00:32:09,445 --> 00:32:11,541
- Alex.
- What about him?

613
00:32:11,566 --> 00:32:14,343
He just got the Attorney
General to sign off on his plan.

614
00:32:14,368 --> 00:32:16,542
The FBI team is already on the way.

615
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:28,960
We need an ETA, Victor.

616
00:32:29,096 --> 00:32:31,604
We need an ETA on that FBI team now.

617
00:32:31,629 --> 00:32:32,929
Working on it.

618
00:32:40,324 --> 00:32:42,060
Damn it.

619
00:32:47,864 --> 00:32:49,426
What are you doing up here?

620
00:32:49,451 --> 00:32:52,515
Alex and the FBI team left
Washington an hour ago.

621
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:55,623
Even if they're driving 90 miles an hour,

622
00:32:55,648 --> 00:32:56,874
we've still got 30 minutes.

623
00:32:56,899 --> 00:32:58,874
They're not coming by car.

624
00:33:05,315 --> 00:33:07,616
Your parents have enough
pressure on them already.

625
00:33:07,651 --> 00:33:09,674
I didn't want to add any more.

626
00:33:11,165 --> 00:33:13,133
They can do this, Natalie.

627
00:33:13,333 --> 00:33:15,701
Your mother did dozens
of covert entries for us.

628
00:33:15,726 --> 00:33:17,727
That was a long time ago.

629
00:33:17,752 --> 00:33:19,286
Those skills were drilled into her.

630
00:33:19,438 --> 00:33:20,839
They'll come back.

631
00:33:20,864 --> 00:33:22,832
What about my dad?

632
00:33:22,866 --> 00:33:25,426
You remember what he did
for us seven years ago?

633
00:33:25,508 --> 00:33:29,926
He's a brilliant engineer. He can do this.

634
00:33:30,271 --> 00:33:32,926
We'll be their eyes and ears,
and they're going to be okay.

635
00:33:35,765 --> 00:33:37,426
And we are too.

636
00:33:40,066 --> 00:33:43,127
I'm going to go back down
to monitor the police bands.

637
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:55,732
Okay, come on. Let's go.

638
00:33:55,757 --> 00:33:58,592
- Okay, that's not very helping.
- Sorry.

639
00:34:01,419 --> 00:34:03,226
Excellent.

640
00:34:20,066 --> 00:34:22,054
Mom? How much longer?

641
00:34:22,468 --> 00:34:24,903
We're a little busy right
now, honey. I don't know.

642
00:34:24,928 --> 00:34:27,627
'Cause Alex and the FBI team
aren't driving, they're flying.

643
00:34:28,323 --> 00:34:29,726
Well, when did they leave DC?

644
00:34:29,751 --> 00:34:32,127
Doesn't matter. They're landing right now.

645
00:35:23,678 --> 00:35:25,655
All right, get them passed out.

646
00:35:25,689 --> 00:35:27,323
Dress covers, boys and girls.

647
00:35:27,366 --> 00:35:30,535
Don't be shy. Made in the U.S.A.

648
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,731
65% rayon, 25% cotton.

649
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,490
And lord knows what else.

650
00:35:35,732 --> 00:35:37,600
Come on, guys. Move, move.

651
00:35:37,634 --> 00:35:40,630
Come on, don't be late.

652
00:36:24,957 --> 00:36:26,758
We're in. Heading to the vault.

653
00:36:26,783 --> 00:36:30,089
No alarm. No dispatch. You're clean.

654
00:36:34,452 --> 00:36:36,950
Both a thriving urban Metropolis,

655
00:36:36,975 --> 00:36:40,289
and an international
city of vibrant diversity.

656
00:36:40,864 --> 00:36:42,465
We're a welcoming city,

657
00:36:42,499 --> 00:36:45,613
regardless of ethnicity or orientation.

658
00:36:45,718 --> 00:36:50,489
We are a Cosmopolitan city
of all races and all faiths.

659
00:37:01,718 --> 00:37:04,116
Tell the security guard
at the service entrance

660
00:37:04,141 --> 00:37:05,474
that the leak is unsubstantiated

661
00:37:05,499 --> 00:37:06,999
so he doesn't get on the radio

662
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:09,517
and call more attention
to this than we want.

663
00:37:11,498 --> 00:37:14,017
I'll give this back to you when we're done.

664
00:37:20,069 --> 00:37:21,857
There's no outlets.

665
00:37:22,095 --> 00:37:25,197
Well, how... how do they vacuum?

666
00:37:25,222 --> 00:37:28,057
We take the prisoners'
staircase to the second floor.

667
00:37:28,082 --> 00:37:30,717
We go courtroom through
courtroom using inner doors.

668
00:37:30,742 --> 00:37:32,676
That will allow us to
enter without alerting

669
00:37:32,701 --> 00:37:34,156
the court police officer.

670
00:37:34,181 --> 00:37:37,757
Now, if they find out
we're here, we're screwed.

671
00:37:39,938 --> 00:37:42,856
If you keep this in your pocket
you can have your ball back.

672
00:37:52,335 --> 00:37:54,257
I got it.

673
00:37:59,078 --> 00:38:00,856
Oh!

674
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:07,572
We have to plug it in,

675
00:38:07,597 --> 00:38:08,997
or we won't be able to get into the vault.

676
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:12,072
- On the count of three. Ready?
- Okay.

677
00:38:12,365 --> 00:38:15,671
One, two...

678
00:38:15,749 --> 00:38:18,971
Three.

679
00:38:22,627 --> 00:38:23,793
Wait a sec.

680
00:39:01,327 --> 00:39:03,061
I mean, what do I do?

681
00:39:03,086 --> 00:39:04,921
Is it safe for me to stay here?

682
00:39:05,656 --> 00:39:07,320
Not really.

683
00:39:14,684 --> 00:39:17,521
Guys, I think the FBI
just entered the building.

684
00:39:24,381 --> 00:39:25,981
Come on.

685
00:39:26,006 --> 00:39:28,007
Come on, let's go.

686
00:39:52,786 --> 00:39:54,587
We got it.

687
00:40:43,269 --> 00:40:45,170
- Anything?
- Nothing here.

688
00:40:45,195 --> 00:40:46,516
Are you sure?

689
00:40:47,801 --> 00:40:50,717
There's nothing here.

690
00:40:51,192 --> 00:40:52,516
That's impossible.

691
00:40:52,821 --> 00:40:55,816
No find. I repeat, no find.

692
00:40:56,519 --> 00:40:58,217
All right, let's clear out.

693
00:40:58,242 --> 00:41:00,617
The SVR got here first.

694
00:41:00,642 --> 00:41:02,417
Maybe.

695
00:41:02,653 --> 00:41:04,816
I'm sorry. We got to get out of here.

696
00:41:04,841 --> 00:41:06,917
The Russians could still be here.

697
00:41:06,942 --> 00:41:09,617
We need to search this
place from top to bottom.

698
00:41:26,918 --> 00:41:28,077
Michelle, come in here.

699
00:41:28,793 --> 00:41:30,794
Michelle.

700
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:34,885
I think there's someone up there.
