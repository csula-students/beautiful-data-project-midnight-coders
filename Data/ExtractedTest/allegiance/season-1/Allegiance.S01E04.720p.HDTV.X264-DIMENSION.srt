1
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:03,536
Previously on Allegiance...

2
00:00:03,561 --> 00:00:05,423
You turn your son into a spy.

3
00:00:05,448 --> 00:00:07,086
An SVR officer said he was close

4
00:00:07,111 --> 00:00:09,684
to launching an operation that
would bring America to its knees.

5
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:10,968
They're calling it Black Dagger.

6
00:00:10,993 --> 00:00:13,179
D.C. is setting up a joint
task force to stop it.

7
00:00:13,204 --> 00:00:14,670
The best plan we have to stop it

8
00:00:14,695 --> 00:00:16,361
is to find the SVR files Miguel stole.

9
00:00:16,386 --> 00:00:19,186
His, uh, Easter Egg, as it's been called.

10
00:00:19,295 --> 00:00:21,662
Tell me the truth or tell the FBI.

11
00:00:21,697 --> 00:00:22,816
I was having an affair.

12
00:00:22,841 --> 00:00:25,007
Yeah, I made up the affair story, Mark.

13
00:00:25,032 --> 00:00:26,914
- Okay?
- Where are the files now?

14
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,372
They're on an encrypted hard
drive, secure inside a laptop.

15
00:00:29,397 --> 00:00:31,330
Only I know how to stop the deletion timer.

16
00:00:31,355 --> 00:00:32,883
The laptop with the SVR files,

17
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:34,808
Miguel hid it in Philadelphia City Hall.

18
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:35,774
If Alex beats you to that laptop,

19
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:37,299
you'll all be dead.

20
00:00:37,324 --> 00:00:40,058
We need your help to make
a copy of the disk drive,

21
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:41,415
remotely, from here.

22
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,571
And then we're gonna trade it for immunity.

23
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,793
- We got it.
- There's nothing here.

24
00:00:46,818 --> 00:00:48,852
The SVR got here first.

25
00:00:55,775 --> 00:00:57,108
Come on. We're pulling out.

26
00:00:57,133 --> 00:00:58,540
No, look, there's a crawl space.

27
00:00:58,565 --> 00:01:00,295
Alex, there's no evidence of a break-in.

28
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,053
Oh, we have to see what's up there.

29
00:01:03,623 --> 00:01:05,623
Prado, O'Connor. Let's go!

30
00:01:09,732 --> 00:01:11,431
Get off the ladder, O'Connor.

31
00:01:11,456 --> 00:01:13,589
We're not gonna compound your
screwup by getting caught.

32
00:01:13,614 --> 00:01:14,731
No, I just, I...

33
00:01:14,756 --> 00:01:16,329
Get the hell off the ladder now! Move!

34
00:01:16,354 --> 00:01:18,414
Uh... okay.

35
00:01:29,898 --> 00:01:31,625
_

36
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,229
Oh, no...

37
00:01:34,266 --> 00:01:35,800
What are you doing here?

38
00:01:35,825 --> 00:01:36,687
Didn't you hear?

39
00:01:36,713 --> 00:01:38,469
There's a gas leak downstairs.

40
00:01:38,494 --> 00:01:40,560
Gas leak?

41
00:01:43,912 --> 00:01:45,278
What's going on?

42
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:46,899
We're stuck in the rafters.

43
00:01:46,924 --> 00:01:48,883
The Rezident just told me.

44
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:50,225
Well, how does he know that?

45
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,631
I don't know.

46
00:01:51,656 --> 00:01:52,940
He clearly has an asset inside,

47
00:01:52,965 --> 00:01:54,764
maybe even on the FBI team.

48
00:01:54,964 --> 00:01:56,280
How soon can you get out of there?

49
00:01:56,305 --> 00:01:58,535
I don't know. It looks
like there's a way out

50
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,319
through the Mayor's Press Room, but...

51
00:02:00,931 --> 00:02:02,940
he's in the middle of a speech right now.

52
00:02:02,965 --> 00:02:05,399
Proudly continue to
strive to be the great city

53
00:02:05,434 --> 00:02:06,700
that we want to be.

54
00:02:06,735 --> 00:02:08,998
To have the future we deserve.

55
00:02:09,023 --> 00:02:11,056
For generations of tomorrow,

56
00:02:11,081 --> 00:02:13,220
all across Philadelphia.

57
00:02:13,697 --> 00:02:16,365
And so, as we celebrate the founding

58
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,024
of our great city, the
birthplace of democracy...

59
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:21,148
He'll be done in 15 minutes.

60
00:02:21,173 --> 00:02:22,406
Leave with the crowd, then rendezvous

61
00:02:22,431 --> 00:02:24,231
in the alley behind the Masonic Temple.

62
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:25,741
Yeah, okay.

63
00:02:25,766 --> 00:02:27,199
And, Mark...

64
00:02:27,224 --> 00:02:29,451
The Rezident has a dozen
men out there at City Hall

65
00:02:29,476 --> 00:02:30,615
as an insurance policy.

66
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,123
If you and Katya aren't here

67
00:02:32,148 --> 00:02:34,192
within ten minutes of that speech ending,

68
00:02:34,217 --> 00:02:36,985
he's going to come after you...

69
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:39,448
or Sarah.

70
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,856
Yeah, we'll be there.

71
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:47,641
If we can't get back to the tunnel,

72
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:49,265
there's no way to copy the drive?

73
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,061
No.

74
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,522
Without a copy,

75
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:53,190
we're right back where we started.

76
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:55,439
We are still caught in the vise.

77
00:02:58,024 --> 00:02:59,351
Unless...

78
00:02:59,941 --> 00:03:02,141
Natalie grabs Sarah...

79
00:03:02,514 --> 00:03:04,347
meets us at the FBI field office,

80
00:03:04,372 --> 00:03:06,226
which is six blocks from here.

81
00:03:06,407 --> 00:03:08,209
We have the laptop. We have the leverage.

82
00:03:08,234 --> 00:03:09,433
- We can make a deal!
- Six blocks!

83
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:10,655
How are we gonna go six blocks

84
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,077
without the Rezident's people spotting us?

85
00:03:12,102 --> 00:03:13,682
We leave now.

86
00:03:13,887 --> 00:03:15,600
There are two subways under City Hall.

87
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,047
There's a concourse that connects them.

88
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:18,380
It's Sunday. It's closed.

89
00:03:18,405 --> 00:03:19,805
The Rezident would never
have anybody down there now.

90
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,062
If we can get into it,
we can travel all the way

91
00:03:22,087 --> 00:03:24,221
to the Federal Building
without ever going above ground.

92
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:26,655
Well, what if he has somebody down there?

93
00:03:28,137 --> 00:03:30,872
Then he shoots us on the spot.

94
00:03:32,075 --> 00:03:34,208
What do you want to do?

95
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:36,648
These are the tenants of a great nation

96
00:03:36,673 --> 00:03:39,141
and are in the beliefs, souls...

97
00:03:39,382 --> 00:03:41,015
I want out...

98
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:44,272
for all of us, for good.

99
00:03:45,718 --> 00:03:47,974
We go now.

100
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,030
Get Sarah.

101
00:03:54,486 --> 00:03:57,542
Now? We... we haven't even copied the...

102
00:03:57,567 --> 00:03:59,553
We can't get to the tunnel,
so we can't make a copy.

103
00:03:59,578 --> 00:04:01,319
- So what are we...
- We're taking

104
00:04:01,344 --> 00:04:03,585
the laptop to the FBI.

105
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:06,506
What? The Rezident has people all over.

106
00:04:06,531 --> 00:04:08,389
Natalie, it's the only way.

107
00:04:08,692 --> 00:04:10,858
Get Sarah and get to the Federal Building

108
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:11,849
in five minutes.

109
00:04:11,874 --> 00:04:13,428
Come on. We have to go.

110
00:04:18,483 --> 00:04:20,650
What the...

111
00:04:38,549 --> 00:04:40,049
Hey, it's Sarah.

112
00:04:40,074 --> 00:04:41,907
Why didn't you text? Leave me a message.

113
00:04:41,932 --> 00:04:43,986
I'm going to kill you.

114
00:04:52,477 --> 00:04:53,977
Hey, it's Sarah.

115
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,802
Why didn't you text? Leave me a message.

116
00:04:55,827 --> 00:04:58,417
You little bitch.

117
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,651
We saw last year some of the
fewest number of homicides

118
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,776
in nearly 50 years.

119
00:05:03,801 --> 00:05:06,936
The lowest number of civilian fire deaths.

120
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:13,952
Today Philadelphia's, in fact,
reclaimed its rightful place

121
00:05:13,977 --> 00:05:16,543
as a global city and a world leader,

122
00:05:16,945 --> 00:05:19,472
a city with a thriving
economy that attracts

123
00:05:19,497 --> 00:05:22,073
major development and is growing.

124
00:05:22,574 --> 00:05:25,032
Hey. Don't tell the mayor
we had to leave early.

125
00:05:25,057 --> 00:05:26,920
You got it, pal.

126
00:05:54,648 --> 00:05:56,539
Natalie, where the hell are your parents?

127
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,331
I don't know. I can't see them from here.

128
00:05:58,356 --> 00:05:59,912
If they're not here within
the next ten minutes,

129
00:05:59,937 --> 00:06:02,117
the Rezident is going to
take this out of my hands.

130
00:06:02,245 --> 00:06:04,119
_

131
00:06:09,504 --> 00:06:11,523
They need enough time
to get out of City Hall

132
00:06:11,548 --> 00:06:12,493
without getting caught.

133
00:06:12,518 --> 00:06:13,607
Is that what the delay is?

134
00:06:13,631 --> 00:06:15,242
They're gonna show up, Victor.

135
00:06:15,268 --> 00:06:17,135
They're not stupid.

136
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:28,362
- We need to check it.
- What?

137
00:06:28,397 --> 00:06:31,131
We need to check the laptop.

138
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,534
Where are the girls?

139
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:34,902
If we don't have something valuable,

140
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:37,137
we're walking into a long prison sentence.

141
00:06:37,173 --> 00:06:38,472
- Okay.
- Come on.

142
00:06:38,507 --> 00:06:40,641
Where are Natalie and Sarah?

143
00:06:40,676 --> 00:06:43,310
You said five minutes.
Didn't you say five minutes?

144
00:06:52,617 --> 00:06:54,038
Okay.

145
00:06:54,063 --> 00:06:56,482
Nitrogen levels, pH balances.

146
00:06:56,508 --> 00:06:58,075
That's nothing.

147
00:06:59,858 --> 00:07:01,491
What is that? Is that something?

148
00:07:01,516 --> 00:07:03,616
No. Soil samples.

149
00:07:04,698 --> 00:07:06,965
Uh, GDP. Average income.

150
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,554
Economic projections. That's...

151
00:07:09,727 --> 00:07:11,593
That's a circuit diagram.

152
00:07:11,618 --> 00:07:14,017
We can't bring this to the FBI.

153
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:16,807
That one. What about that?

154
00:07:16,832 --> 00:07:18,832
Chrenyy Kinzhal.

155
00:07:18,857 --> 00:07:22,225
- What does that mean?
- Black Dagger.

156
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:26,585
- That's got to be real.
- It better be...

157
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,091
if we're gonna walk in
there and admit to treason.

158
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,466
What's that?

159
00:07:31,491 --> 00:07:33,558
What does that mean?

160
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:34,918
It needs a separate password.

161
00:07:34,943 --> 00:07:37,177
Ah. It's gonna format.

162
00:07:38,213 --> 00:07:40,853
Uh... what's happening?

163
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:42,444
What's happening with the file?

164
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:44,431
- It's deleting.
- What's happening?

165
00:07:44,456 --> 00:07:45,532
- What is it doing?
- The hard drive.

166
00:07:45,558 --> 00:07:47,311
The whole hard drive is...

167
00:07:47,336 --> 00:07:51,071
Oh, the entire hard drive is gone.

168
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:06,681
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

169
00:08:07,508 --> 00:08:08,697
What were you thinking?

170
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:10,603
We had to make sure there
was something valuable enough

171
00:08:10,628 --> 00:08:12,536
to get us immunity, to get protection.

172
00:08:12,561 --> 00:08:14,134
Well, there was, but now there isn't.

173
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:15,586
You just killed us.

174
00:08:16,754 --> 00:08:18,431
It's 10 minutes past
the Rezident's deadline.

175
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,220
You're gonna bring him this?

176
00:08:19,245 --> 00:08:20,835
Well, maybe we found the laptop like this.

177
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,615
- He'll never believe that.
- Where's Sarah?

178
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,080
She snuck out to Macy's.

179
00:08:24,105 --> 00:08:25,541
I ran after her, but then you guy's called.

180
00:08:25,565 --> 00:08:27,528
- Where is she now?
- I left her at Macy's.

181
00:08:27,953 --> 00:08:29,789
The SVR won't try anything there.

182
00:08:29,814 --> 00:08:31,236
It's full of cameras and customers.

183
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,398
She's right. She's safer
there than anywhere else.

184
00:08:33,423 --> 00:08:35,519
Maybe we should all go to
Macy's and exchange the laptop.

185
00:08:35,544 --> 00:08:37,680
That way we won't be killed.

186
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,292
What?

187
00:08:39,317 --> 00:08:40,523
I just got an idea.

188
00:08:40,548 --> 00:08:42,582
- To do what?
- Save us.

189
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:44,726
But you said the hard drive
was destroyed. What can you do?

190
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:46,584
It is, but the solid-state
layer is still intact.

191
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:49,444
If I can encrypt it, the
Rezident won't see this.

192
00:08:49,746 --> 00:08:51,580
He'll never know what you did.

193
00:08:51,605 --> 00:08:54,097
But you're gonna need to really sell it.

194
00:08:59,601 --> 00:09:01,741
Cops were everywhere. We didn't
have any press credentials.

195
00:09:01,766 --> 00:09:04,153
Last thing we wanted was
to get caught with this.

196
00:09:27,128 --> 00:09:28,855
_

197
00:09:56,742 --> 00:09:57,808
Hey!

198
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,013
We did everything you asked.

199
00:10:07,038 --> 00:10:09,467
I think you did more than that, Katya.

200
00:10:09,861 --> 00:10:11,808
That's why you took so long.

201
00:10:14,775 --> 00:10:17,137
We did nothing. We came
as soon as it was safe.

202
00:10:17,162 --> 00:10:18,664
I think you're a liar.

203
00:10:18,874 --> 00:10:20,274
I think you looked at the files

204
00:10:20,299 --> 00:10:22,423
and the self-destruct protocol took over,

205
00:10:22,448 --> 00:10:24,131
just like I think you shot my sniper

206
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:25,904
in the back of the head.

207
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,576
Police thought he was
killed with his own pistol.

208
00:10:29,979 --> 00:10:31,879
Then they realized that
was just a diversion

209
00:10:31,904 --> 00:10:34,505
to keep them from looking
for the real murder weapon.

210
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:38,070
If you kill me now, the
FBI is going to assign

211
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,005
a dozen counterintelligence agents

212
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,930
to investigate Alex to see
if there's a connection.

213
00:10:41,966 --> 00:10:44,879
You lose him as a source forever.

214
00:10:44,904 --> 00:10:46,600
And you're gonna give the FBI

215
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,091
an awful lot of strings to pull

216
00:10:48,116 --> 00:10:50,082
which you are at the end of.

217
00:10:55,475 --> 00:10:58,179
_

218
00:11:00,645 --> 00:11:02,461
The laptop will go to Moscow.

219
00:11:03,905 --> 00:11:06,192
They'll get through the
encryption eventually.

220
00:11:06,217 --> 00:11:08,505
And then we will know if
you're telling the truth.

221
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:12,752
Until then, we will be watching you.

222
00:11:12,989 --> 00:11:16,688
Every minute of the day and night.

223
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,582
You and your whole family.

224
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:42,459
He's going to kill us eventually.

225
00:11:42,484 --> 00:11:43,516
That's his plan.

226
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,441
The SVR needs Alex. You said it.

227
00:11:45,466 --> 00:11:47,666
No, I mean him personally.

228
00:11:47,691 --> 00:11:49,224
He's a psychopath.

229
00:11:49,249 --> 00:11:51,344
He enjoys feeding people into furnaces.

230
00:11:52,741 --> 00:11:55,274
You know what? We have this.

231
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:57,232
The movie I took of the file deleting.

232
00:11:57,568 --> 00:11:59,224
We break the encryption, it might be enough

233
00:11:59,249 --> 00:12:00,272
to take to the FBI.

234
00:12:00,296 --> 00:12:01,723
Still, when the time is right,

235
00:12:02,395 --> 00:12:04,505
I'm going to kill him.

236
00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:06,675
What?

237
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,395
Witness protection or
no witness protection,

238
00:12:08,419 --> 00:12:11,239
that man has to die for
our family to be safe.

239
00:12:14,347 --> 00:12:16,039
Any idea where the hell we are?

240
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,324
Camden, New Jersey.

241
00:12:19,249 --> 00:12:20,840
How could you possibly know that?

242
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,647
We had bags over our heads.

243
00:12:22,847 --> 00:12:25,943
The SVR didn't send you
to recruit an idiot, honey.

244
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,400
That way.

245
00:12:34,224 --> 00:12:36,457
Happy Easter, O'Connor.

246
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,183
Well, this is a disgrace.

247
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,942
The bus is 45 minutes
late according to this.

248
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:52,509
No wonder no one takes
public transportation anymore.

249
00:12:52,534 --> 00:12:55,002
You saw a landmark or something, right?

250
00:12:55,027 --> 00:12:57,498
A billboard that said "Camden" on it? I...

251
00:12:57,523 --> 00:13:00,409
It's just travel time, number of turns.

252
00:13:00,449 --> 00:13:02,581
It's just deduction.

253
00:13:02,606 --> 00:13:05,273
Well, at least we know where
Alex gets his brain from.

254
00:13:05,298 --> 00:13:06,898
He's got plenty of your brain too.

255
00:13:06,923 --> 00:13:09,808
Yeah. The part where he can't filter

256
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,269
anything he says before he says it.

257
00:13:11,294 --> 00:13:12,993
That part's definitely from me.

258
00:13:18,425 --> 00:13:20,926
Can we talk?

259
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:24,396
We need to talk about us.

260
00:13:27,643 --> 00:13:29,209
It's time.

261
00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:40,797
You were in Riyadh...

262
00:13:41,246 --> 00:13:42,545
for a project.

263
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:45,437
You were gone six months that time.

264
00:13:47,652 --> 00:13:50,406
I was alone with the children.

265
00:13:53,024 --> 00:13:55,524
Alex was really struggling.

266
00:13:57,895 --> 00:14:01,631
And I felt like I was...

267
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,232
drowning.

268
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:11,040
Who?

269
00:14:11,075 --> 00:14:13,442
Are you sure you really want to know that?

270
00:14:16,309 --> 00:14:17,766
No.

271
00:14:19,531 --> 00:14:21,531
How about why?

272
00:14:25,123 --> 00:14:27,449
To escape.

273
00:14:27,892 --> 00:14:30,758
To feel something besides...

274
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:33,872
fear.

275
00:14:33,897 --> 00:14:36,755
We were going through a very
dark time in our relationship.

276
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,819
Do you remember how angry you were with me

277
00:14:40,143 --> 00:14:42,746
when you found out how much...

278
00:14:43,534 --> 00:14:45,774
how much more than support
I was doing for the SVR?

279
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:49,223
- Katya, please.
- You almost left me, Mark.

280
00:14:49,251 --> 00:14:51,839
You did leave me...

281
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:55,417
just three, four, six months at a time.

282
00:14:55,453 --> 00:14:58,053
I mean, you said they were work trips,

283
00:14:58,089 --> 00:14:59,822
but we both know that you
could've gotten out of them.

284
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:02,351
No, stop it. Stop it.

285
00:15:02,518 --> 00:15:04,852
I wasn't perfect back then either.

286
00:15:08,558 --> 00:15:10,792
I know.

287
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,537
You know?

288
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,994
All these years you never said anything?

289
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:21,809
I was trying to do one thing right

290
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:24,601
for our children, just one thing.

291
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:32,405
We got through that.

292
00:15:34,428 --> 00:15:38,063
We can get through this, can't we?

293
00:15:38,088 --> 00:15:40,555
We have to.

294
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,779
I can't make it without you.

295
00:16:00,636 --> 00:16:03,304
Oh, my God. Is that the Director?

296
00:16:03,456 --> 00:16:07,434
The Director? Alex, jacket.

297
00:16:12,153 --> 00:16:13,777
Where is he?

298
00:16:13,802 --> 00:16:17,386
I, um, think he stepped
across the street for coffee,

299
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:18,810
a cup of coffee, sir.

300
00:16:18,835 --> 00:16:20,434
We had no idea you were coming.

301
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,378
A cup of coffee.

302
00:16:23,561 --> 00:16:26,362
Easter eggs. Hilarious.

303
00:16:26,387 --> 00:16:28,019
Who thought of this?

304
00:16:28,044 --> 00:16:30,326
O'Neill, sir.

305
00:16:30,508 --> 00:16:33,116
Well, I'm glad someone
can still find the funny

306
00:16:33,141 --> 00:16:35,441
in all of this, because I can tell you,

307
00:16:35,572 --> 00:16:39,164
the Attorney General is
not frickin' laughing.

308
00:16:39,653 --> 00:16:42,709
And the President...
he's not laughing either.

309
00:16:43,444 --> 00:16:46,630
And why the hell are you
playing with that squash ball?

310
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,797
It helps me think, sir.

311
00:16:48,822 --> 00:16:50,627
It was a rhetorical question.

312
00:16:50,652 --> 00:16:52,018
Sorry.

313
00:16:52,043 --> 00:16:53,752
Sorry because you answered the question

314
00:16:53,777 --> 00:16:55,885
or because you made us all look like

315
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,231
a bunch of jackasses?

316
00:16:57,256 --> 00:16:58,222
Sir, if I may...

317
00:16:58,247 --> 00:16:59,714
No, you may not,

318
00:16:59,739 --> 00:17:02,128
because I'm not finished yet.

319
00:17:02,179 --> 00:17:05,676
The FISA judge reviewing the
AG's emergency search order

320
00:17:05,701 --> 00:17:09,470
has decided that he wants to
fly up here day after tomorrow

321
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:12,714
because he wants to hear
directly from you idiots

322
00:17:12,739 --> 00:17:14,839
how you could be so confident

323
00:17:14,864 --> 00:17:17,902
as to what you would find
and still be so flatly wrong.

324
00:17:17,927 --> 00:17:19,627
But... we weren't wrong.

325
00:17:19,652 --> 00:17:20,651
Alex, don't.

326
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:22,907
I'm sorry?

327
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,241
What'd you say?

328
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,487
Mikhail's laptop was in City Hall.

329
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:28,536
The SVR just beat us to it.

330
00:17:29,228 --> 00:17:30,994
Really?

331
00:17:31,194 --> 00:17:32,827
Okay, well,

332
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:36,187
just dump that bucket of
proof right over my head.

333
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,259
Then shut the hell up

334
00:17:39,284 --> 00:17:41,217
and let me tell you
what's gonna happen next.

335
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:44,419
You and you and whoever else in this room

336
00:17:44,444 --> 00:17:46,511
who was behind you in this,

337
00:17:46,536 --> 00:17:48,011
are gonna go before that judge,

338
00:17:48,036 --> 00:17:49,669
and you're gonna own this screwup.

339
00:17:50,007 --> 00:17:53,231
And you better do a good job
of it, because if you don't,

340
00:17:54,135 --> 00:17:56,101
you're gonna spend the rest of your career

341
00:17:56,126 --> 00:18:00,361
analyzing historical trends
of Soviet grain reports.

342
00:18:00,386 --> 00:18:02,991
And, you, you'll get permanently promoted

343
00:18:03,016 --> 00:18:05,834
to the make-work and meaningless cases desk

344
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:08,627
in our Peoria satellite office.

345
00:18:08,747 --> 00:18:11,574
As for the judge, well, he
may take a look at all this

346
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:13,866
and just decide that this task force

347
00:18:13,891 --> 00:18:15,281
and the leeway that you've been given

348
00:18:15,306 --> 00:18:16,730
is nothing more than a recipe

349
00:18:16,755 --> 00:18:20,301
for constitutional infringement
and shut you all down!

350
00:18:28,171 --> 00:18:31,406
Nice job, O'Connor.

351
00:18:50,698 --> 00:18:53,897
You come up here to think or to jump?

352
00:18:55,764 --> 00:18:57,945
Does it have to be one or the other?

353
00:18:58,239 --> 00:19:00,072
What about the view?

354
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,997
No, that's banal.

355
00:19:02,022 --> 00:19:04,856
You're not a banal guy.

356
00:19:05,318 --> 00:19:07,585
Listen, don't worry about
what the FBI Director

357
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,009
said down there.

358
00:19:09,034 --> 00:19:10,418
Why?

359
00:19:10,443 --> 00:19:13,009
Well, first off, because
he's the FBI Director.

360
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,368
Second, I'm not so sure you were wrong.

361
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,704
What makes you say that?

362
00:19:20,729 --> 00:19:23,597
25 years in the field.

363
00:19:27,557 --> 00:19:29,090
So what do I do?

364
00:19:29,115 --> 00:19:31,754
Without the laptop, how
do we stop the SVR's plan?

365
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:34,417
Find out what happened in Philly,

366
00:19:34,442 --> 00:19:36,032
and we'll be back on track.

367
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:38,583
Oh, and, uh...

368
00:19:38,608 --> 00:19:40,432
if gathering that
evidence requires anything

369
00:19:40,457 --> 00:19:43,024
other than your computer,
bring Michelle along, okay?

370
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:44,516
She'll keep you out of trouble.

371
00:19:44,675 --> 00:19:45,839
Scratch that.

372
00:19:45,863 --> 00:19:47,681
She probably won't keep you out of trouble,

373
00:19:47,706 --> 00:19:50,808
but just bring her anyways.

374
00:19:55,897 --> 00:19:58,297
Natalie.

375
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:02,817
I was so worried.

376
00:20:02,842 --> 00:20:05,539
We're okay. We're okay.
We're okay. We're okay.

377
00:20:07,367 --> 00:20:09,400
We're only safe until the
SVR breaks the encryption

378
00:20:09,425 --> 00:20:11,959
on that laptop, so how long
do we have, bottom line?

379
00:20:11,984 --> 00:20:15,853
It's a hundred-plus-character
password I entered randomly.

380
00:20:15,878 --> 00:20:18,149
I mean, it should take them years.

381
00:20:18,174 --> 00:20:19,874
But, of course, if they threw enough

382
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:21,348
processing power at it...

383
00:20:21,373 --> 00:20:23,673
So it could be a month?

384
00:20:23,698 --> 00:20:25,331
A month would be almost impossible.

385
00:20:25,356 --> 00:20:26,722
Then assume we have a month.

386
00:20:26,747 --> 00:20:28,061
Yeah.

387
00:20:29,031 --> 00:20:30,845
What?

388
00:20:31,033 --> 00:20:33,549
I'm just racking my
brain trying to remember

389
00:20:33,574 --> 00:20:35,474
if I made any mistake,

390
00:20:35,499 --> 00:20:37,276
left any back door.

391
00:20:37,434 --> 00:20:39,300
Yes, well?

392
00:20:39,325 --> 00:20:42,565
I, uh... a month. We're safe for a month.

393
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:45,646
Well, we need to break the
code on this video before then.

394
00:20:46,988 --> 00:20:49,291
Any fragment of the Intel Mikhail stole

395
00:20:49,316 --> 00:20:51,490
could be valuable to us.

396
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:55,362
I know how to encrypt something.
I don't know how to decrypt it...

397
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,034
I mean, especially not something like that.

398
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:59,524
But you know somebody, right?

399
00:21:01,191 --> 00:21:04,359
I know one person, but I can't go to him.

400
00:21:04,384 --> 00:21:05,901
Why not?

401
00:21:05,926 --> 00:21:08,760
I-I just...

402
00:21:09,047 --> 00:21:11,226
What? Is he a security concern?

403
00:21:11,373 --> 00:21:13,339
He's not connected to the Russians, is he?

404
00:21:13,364 --> 00:21:15,154
No, nothing like that.

405
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:16,937
Then what?

406
00:21:18,239 --> 00:21:19,939
Okay, you know what? I...

407
00:21:19,964 --> 00:21:22,031
I'm not sure what's
going on between you two,

408
00:21:22,056 --> 00:21:23,923
but I do know this,

409
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:25,900
if we lose focus on how precarious

410
00:21:25,925 --> 00:21:28,043
our situation is, just for a moment,

411
00:21:28,068 --> 00:21:30,393
we lose everything, and I mean everything!

412
00:21:30,949 --> 00:21:32,716
So I'm gonna go get the car.

413
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:36,471
And when I come back, I want
you two to have worked out

414
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:38,515
whatever the hell's going on between you.

415
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,344
Please.

416
00:21:46,577 --> 00:21:47,577
_

417
00:21:47,602 --> 00:21:48,602
_

418
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,360
_

419
00:21:50,626 --> 00:21:54,349
Listen, I know Philadelphia
didn't go exactly as planned

420
00:21:54,382 --> 00:21:56,454
but you have to remember the
decision that you made there.

421
00:21:56,479 --> 00:21:58,951
What... to condemn my boyfriend

422
00:21:58,976 --> 00:22:00,978
to burn in a furnace like Mikhail did?

423
00:22:01,003 --> 00:22:04,595
_

424
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,086
Boyfriend?

425
00:22:06,111 --> 00:22:08,931
That's a nice, clean word for it.

426
00:22:09,803 --> 00:22:12,470
You're so cruel sometimes.

427
00:22:14,335 --> 00:22:16,269
Natasha...

428
00:22:17,427 --> 00:22:19,048
_

429
00:22:20,513 --> 00:22:23,118
I am trying to protect you.

430
00:22:23,544 --> 00:22:25,295
And not that it's my greatest concern,

431
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,751
but you being with Victor,

432
00:22:26,776 --> 00:22:29,009
you put him at huge risk.

433
00:22:29,034 --> 00:22:31,769
What would the Rezident do
if he found out about you two?

434
00:22:31,794 --> 00:22:34,977
You have to break up with him.

435
00:22:38,268 --> 00:22:40,435
I know.

436
00:23:48,025 --> 00:23:50,543
This better be good.

437
00:23:51,758 --> 00:23:54,752
Why didn't that alarm sound
when we opened the door?

438
00:24:09,077 --> 00:24:12,079
Now arriving track four, Amtrak train 2164.

439
00:24:12,114 --> 00:24:13,413
We need to hurry.

440
00:24:13,449 --> 00:24:14,977
Building's only open to the public

441
00:24:15,002 --> 00:24:16,771
until 11:00 a.m. every day.

442
00:24:28,397 --> 00:24:30,530
And here I thought our romance died.

443
00:24:30,566 --> 00:24:32,666
This is about business.

444
00:24:32,709 --> 00:24:34,644
Maybe we can mix the two again.

445
00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:38,237
Not anymore. I need this decrypted.

446
00:24:38,262 --> 00:24:39,905
What is it?

447
00:24:52,429 --> 00:24:54,463
I need it fast. I'll pay
double your going rate.

448
00:24:54,488 --> 00:24:57,143
How about you come back
to me and I do it for free?

449
00:24:58,223 --> 00:25:00,044
I'm seeing somebody.

450
00:25:00,069 --> 00:25:01,902
Yeah? And I'm booked up.

451
00:25:02,197 --> 00:25:04,965
Could be a month before I get through this.

452
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,466
Get... Wait, wait, wait.
I'm just kidding, Natalie.

453
00:25:07,827 --> 00:25:09,794
You used to like the verbal sparring.

454
00:25:09,819 --> 00:25:11,980
Remember?

455
00:25:15,124 --> 00:25:17,892
I'll get started on it right away.

456
00:25:21,096 --> 00:25:23,747
Thank you.

457
00:25:31,089 --> 00:25:32,599
I can't believe she wore that.

458
00:25:32,624 --> 00:25:34,627
I can't believe she put it on Instagram.

459
00:25:34,652 --> 00:25:36,042
What a whore.

460
00:25:39,735 --> 00:25:41,701
Uh, no, I'm okay.

461
00:25:41,737 --> 00:25:43,703
Hey, girls.

462
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:46,309
We're too young for you, cowboy.

463
00:25:46,334 --> 00:25:47,600
Yeah, how old is that?

464
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:49,291
I think what she meant to say was,

465
00:25:49,316 --> 00:25:51,083
buzz off, you perv.

466
00:25:51,108 --> 00:25:53,108
NYPD, jackoff. Get up against the wall.

467
00:25:53,626 --> 00:25:55,720
All of you, up against the wall now.

468
00:26:07,467 --> 00:26:09,167
Excuse me, ma'am.

469
00:26:29,718 --> 00:26:31,751
It's huge up here.

470
00:26:31,787 --> 00:26:33,353
There was somebody here.

471
00:26:33,388 --> 00:26:34,721
You don't know that for sure.

472
00:26:34,756 --> 00:26:36,289
Team of two, man and a woman,

473
00:26:36,325 --> 00:26:37,924
judging by the shoe size.

474
00:26:37,959 --> 00:26:39,459
Look how the dust has been displaced.

475
00:26:39,494 --> 00:26:40,860
Mostly near the balls of the feet.

476
00:26:40,896 --> 00:26:43,097
Some don't even have heel prints.

477
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:45,535
They were running.

478
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,959
They heard us come in.

479
00:26:46,984 --> 00:26:48,617
Ah!

480
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:51,254
Why didn't the op team leader
at least let us search it?

481
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:52,527
I should...

482
00:26:52,754 --> 00:26:54,921
I should have covered for you, okay?

483
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,478
I'm your partner.

484
00:26:56,503 --> 00:26:58,808
I should have run
interference with the boss

485
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:01,200
or told him I heard something.

486
00:27:01,225 --> 00:27:02,624
I'm sorry.

487
00:27:05,202 --> 00:27:06,902
It's okay.

488
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,134
We should... we should keep looking.

489
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,159
Watch the footprints.

490
00:27:21,196 --> 00:27:23,196
The blueprints show
only one other way down,

491
00:27:23,221 --> 00:27:24,787
into the Mayor's wing.

492
00:27:24,812 --> 00:27:26,211
There's a police post at both ends.

493
00:27:26,236 --> 00:27:28,220
If they went out that
way, they were forced to.

494
00:27:28,245 --> 00:27:31,379
It certainly doesn't make sense
for them to come in that way.

495
00:27:31,404 --> 00:27:35,157
If I were them, I would've
come in the same way we did.

496
00:27:37,719 --> 00:27:38,952
Let's say you're right,

497
00:27:38,987 --> 00:27:40,524
that the Russians did come in this way.

498
00:27:40,549 --> 00:27:42,182
How did they get in the basement?

499
00:27:42,207 --> 00:27:44,040
Security's posted at the service entrance.

500
00:27:44,065 --> 00:27:47,666
They must've found another way in.

501
00:27:47,691 --> 00:27:49,991
How you doing?

502
00:27:50,016 --> 00:27:51,692
We're with Allied Exterminators.

503
00:27:51,717 --> 00:27:53,596
Trying to find the source
of this rat infestation

504
00:27:53,621 --> 00:27:55,498
before our whole team comes Monday.

505
00:27:55,523 --> 00:27:59,106
Really? Good luck with that.

506
00:27:59,131 --> 00:28:01,065
Is there any other way into the basement

507
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:02,529
besides the service entrance?

508
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:03,954
For a rat, sure.

509
00:28:03,979 --> 00:28:05,278
For us. For our team.

510
00:28:05,303 --> 00:28:08,012
Not really. Loading dock is it.

511
00:28:08,037 --> 00:28:10,301
Well, except for an old tunnel

512
00:28:10,326 --> 00:28:13,035
but that's been closed off since the '70s.

513
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,886
This way?

514
00:28:14,911 --> 00:28:17,395
- What were you thinking?
- I wasn't even smoking it.

515
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,965
You lied to us. You skipped school.

516
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:22,707
It's gym. In what world do
I ever need to climb a rope?

517
00:28:22,732 --> 00:28:25,677
You were dishonest with us,
Sarah. That is why we're upset.

518
00:28:25,718 --> 00:28:27,944
Seriously? The double standard around here

519
00:28:27,969 --> 00:28:29,034
is, like, pathetic.

520
00:28:29,059 --> 00:28:31,202
We don't tell you everything,
because there's some things

521
00:28:31,227 --> 00:28:33,127
kids don't need to know.

522
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:37,054
I may be young, but I'm not Alex.

523
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:38,498
I love him to death.

524
00:28:38,522 --> 00:28:40,920
I mean, he's the only one
of you who's not crazy,

525
00:28:40,945 --> 00:28:43,212
but I see things.

526
00:28:43,237 --> 00:28:45,671
I can read between the lines.

527
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:47,830
This kind of BS doesn't work on me

528
00:28:47,855 --> 00:28:50,022
the way it works on him.

529
00:28:50,047 --> 00:28:51,647
Okay?

530
00:29:00,378 --> 00:29:02,412
Do you think she knows something?

531
00:29:02,437 --> 00:29:05,248
I think, no matter how careful you are,

532
00:29:05,892 --> 00:29:08,375
you can never hide who
you are from your family.

533
00:29:08,658 --> 00:29:10,358
She may not know the details,

534
00:29:10,383 --> 00:29:13,142
but she knows we're keeping
something very big from her.

535
00:29:13,533 --> 00:29:16,033
There's a gate down there.

536
00:29:16,058 --> 00:29:18,016
Straight out of<i> National
Treasure</i> in here.

537
00:29:18,041 --> 00:29:19,696
I never read it.

538
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,854
It's a movie...

539
00:29:21,879 --> 00:29:24,113
starred Nicolas Cage.

540
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:25,971
Never mind.

541
00:29:29,982 --> 00:29:31,682
What is it?

542
00:29:31,707 --> 00:29:33,474
Residue.

543
00:29:33,499 --> 00:29:35,666
What kind of residue?

544
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:37,458
I'm not sure.

545
00:29:37,765 --> 00:29:41,233
But this is where a padlock would've gone.

546
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:55,572
Wow.

547
00:29:57,072 --> 00:29:59,216
Whoever planned this
operation was very good,

548
00:29:59,241 --> 00:30:01,018
but they were working on short notice.

549
00:30:01,231 --> 00:30:03,698
How can you know that?

550
00:30:04,085 --> 00:30:07,017
Because they were probably
filmed with that camera.

551
00:30:18,021 --> 00:30:19,576
The problem with asking for their footage

552
00:30:19,601 --> 00:30:21,022
is they will ask why we need it.

553
00:30:21,047 --> 00:30:22,180
So we tell them.

554
00:30:22,205 --> 00:30:23,972
It's all classified.

555
00:30:23,997 --> 00:30:26,274
So we go for a FISA warrant
and ask for the judge

556
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:27,758
to keep our reasoning under seal.

557
00:30:27,783 --> 00:30:29,294
Do you really think Justice will support us

558
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:31,355
on another warrant after
the reaming we got yesterday?

559
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,919
It's the only way to prove what happened.

560
00:30:32,944 --> 00:30:34,175
Look, I believe you.

561
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,903
You were right.

562
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:38,423
But they don't.

563
00:30:38,448 --> 00:30:40,968
You've got to let those
cameras go right now, okay?

564
00:30:40,993 --> 00:30:42,818
Trust me. We'll come back to them,

565
00:30:42,843 --> 00:30:45,790
but only after we build the
case out with something else.

566
00:30:53,182 --> 00:30:54,182
_

567
00:30:54,206 --> 00:30:55,004
_

568
00:30:55,004 --> 00:30:56,574
_

569
00:30:59,085 --> 00:31:00,614
_

570
00:31:05,691 --> 00:31:08,759
You seriously have to relay
every one of her texts?

571
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:12,419
Yep. Even the ones that say "Moms suck."

572
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,502
I don't think you should be doing that.

573
00:31:14,527 --> 00:31:16,127
That's like reading her diary.

574
00:31:16,152 --> 00:31:17,652
She keeps a diary?

575
00:31:17,677 --> 00:31:19,477
She's a good kid, Katya.

576
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,912
Yeah, she's a good kid who's
hanging out with bad kids.

577
00:31:21,937 --> 00:31:23,456
And she puts herself in danger

578
00:31:23,488 --> 00:31:25,808
every time she does something
stupid and rebellious.

579
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:26,574
The Rezident...

580
00:31:26,598 --> 00:31:28,832
The Rezident is our fault...

581
00:31:28,857 --> 00:31:31,091
our responsibility.

582
00:32:00,158 --> 00:32:02,209
What are you thinking?

583
00:32:02,536 --> 00:32:04,903
I'm thinking SEPTA won't ask
the same kind of questions

584
00:32:04,928 --> 00:32:07,094
a private organization will.

585
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:09,075
I'm thinking if you flash
your badge and ask nicely,

586
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,657
they'll give you all their footage.

587
00:32:10,682 --> 00:32:13,116
What footage? And what's SEPTA?

588
00:32:13,141 --> 00:32:15,395
SEPTA. They run the city buses here.

589
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,554
Philly's MTA.

590
00:32:17,579 --> 00:32:21,135
Most buses these days have
cameras facing the doors.

591
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,394
We don't need to see the
Russians inside the Masonic Temple

592
00:32:23,419 --> 00:32:25,753
if we can see them going in and out.

593
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:29,833
Let's go check it out.

594
00:32:30,859 --> 00:32:34,601
_

595
00:32:39,503 --> 00:32:42,034
Uh, excuse me, do you know
how much longer it will be?

596
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:43,492
A couple of more hours, at least.

597
00:32:43,517 --> 00:32:45,975
A couple... a couple more hours?

598
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,283
We have really old computers.

599
00:32:58,478 --> 00:33:01,631
So, when they recruit you
Agency guys, do they entice you

600
00:33:01,656 --> 00:33:04,464
with true stories of derring-do, like, say...

601
00:33:04,489 --> 00:33:05,855
this?

602
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,480
No.

603
00:33:10,657 --> 00:33:13,058
Why'd you join the FBI?

604
00:33:14,141 --> 00:33:17,243
They sent a really cute
recruiter to my school.

605
00:33:17,268 --> 00:33:18,968
That's it?

606
00:33:21,435 --> 00:33:25,128
I get to carry a gun and arrest bad people.

607
00:33:25,153 --> 00:33:27,153
What's not to love?

608
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:37,954
Next stop, Penn Station, New York City.

609
00:33:50,089 --> 00:33:51,089
_

610
00:33:54,177 --> 00:33:55,177
_

611
00:33:59,981 --> 00:34:01,781
I know.

612
00:34:01,886 --> 00:34:05,922
Well, I've paid the check.
I'm late for a meeting.

613
00:34:06,082 --> 00:34:07,882
And we haven't talked.

614
00:34:11,377 --> 00:34:15,701
I'm happy to talk about
us if you want to talk.

615
00:34:19,574 --> 00:34:22,608
I wish we could spend more time together.

616
00:34:25,517 --> 00:34:29,018
I always want spend more time with you...

617
00:34:29,687 --> 00:34:31,486
even when I shouldn't.

618
00:34:33,026 --> 00:34:35,477
You're like...

619
00:34:36,122 --> 00:34:38,723
You're my Kryptonite, Natalia.

620
00:34:41,789 --> 00:34:43,594
I'll come by tonight when I'm done.

621
00:35:11,459 --> 00:35:13,826
I see you still like our place.

622
00:35:16,941 --> 00:35:18,374
Is that the new guy?

623
00:35:18,399 --> 00:35:20,144
Rebound?

624
00:35:20,169 --> 00:35:22,455
You were the new guy, Stephen.

625
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,381
He's just the guy.

626
00:35:25,406 --> 00:35:27,344
Did you decrypt the file?

627
00:35:27,981 --> 00:35:30,529
Only a foreign intelligence
agency could pull off

628
00:35:30,554 --> 00:35:32,184
that kind of encryption.

629
00:35:32,208 --> 00:35:33,755
You're playing at a higher-stakes table

630
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,608
than I thought.

631
00:35:36,038 --> 00:35:37,571
What do you mean?

632
00:35:37,596 --> 00:35:40,318
"Five PSI overpressure at one kilometer."

633
00:35:40,343 --> 00:35:42,309
- Know what that means?
- No.

634
00:35:42,334 --> 00:35:44,870
It means we're talking
about a blast radius,

635
00:35:44,895 --> 00:35:48,037
a half-a-mile blast radius.

636
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,430
Half a mile?

637
00:35:50,455 --> 00:35:52,259
Don't want to guess how
many people that would kill

638
00:35:52,284 --> 00:35:54,151
in Manhattan.

639
00:35:54,176 --> 00:35:57,415
These other numbers are bank accounts.

640
00:35:57,944 --> 00:36:01,124
So you got money whipping
all around the world

641
00:36:01,149 --> 00:36:04,285
and a plan to make a very big explosion.

642
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:07,778
I'm gonna be getting out
of Manhattan for a while.

643
00:36:07,803 --> 00:36:10,507
You might want to do the same.

644
00:36:30,827 --> 00:36:32,352
Are you sure we're okay here?

645
00:36:32,377 --> 00:36:33,661
I re-swept everything

646
00:36:33,686 --> 00:36:35,599
and ungrounded Sarah
so she wouldn't be here.

647
00:36:37,044 --> 00:36:39,911
Okay, tell us.

648
00:36:39,936 --> 00:36:41,664
It's bad.

649
00:36:50,226 --> 00:36:51,759
What are you two doing?

650
00:36:51,784 --> 00:36:53,676
Looking at footage from
video cameras on the buses

651
00:36:53,701 --> 00:36:56,418
that pass outside the Masonic Temple.

652
00:36:57,746 --> 00:37:00,046
The death toll from an
explosion this size...

653
00:37:00,071 --> 00:37:01,804
It could start a war.

654
00:37:01,829 --> 00:37:03,564
Which Russia doesn't want to do.

655
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:04,713
This doesn't make sense.

656
00:37:04,738 --> 00:37:06,693
Either way, we take
this to the authorities,

657
00:37:06,718 --> 00:37:08,263
they have to grant us immunity, right?

658
00:37:08,288 --> 00:37:10,376
Because we bring them a blast radius? No.

659
00:37:10,401 --> 00:37:13,064
It could just be an impact
assessment of a weapon.

660
00:37:13,769 --> 00:37:16,209
Was there anything in
what Gallagher decrypted

661
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,568
that indicated an actual plan?

662
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:22,187
Account numbers, nothing else.

663
00:37:22,212 --> 00:37:24,946
So we need to find out who
controls those accounts.

664
00:37:24,971 --> 00:37:26,204
Yeah.

665
00:37:32,155 --> 00:37:34,708
I think I found something.

666
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:47,411
See? There he is.

667
00:37:47,436 --> 00:37:48,702
How do you know it's them?

668
00:37:48,727 --> 00:37:50,409
Well, this footage is from Sunday.

669
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,225
The Masonic Temple is closed on Sundays.

670
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:54,187
We can't see his face.

671
00:37:54,212 --> 00:37:56,043
Yeah, but if he goes in...

672
00:37:56,068 --> 00:37:57,868
He has to come out.

673
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:07,955
Hey, what are you doing here?

674
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,523
That's your stuff.

675
00:38:09,548 --> 00:38:11,248
What?

676
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,884
I had my locks changed. I
need to get away from you.

677
00:38:14,909 --> 00:38:16,900
What are you talking about?

678
00:38:16,924 --> 00:38:20,187
This afternoon you were saying
the complete opposite thing.

679
00:38:21,985 --> 00:38:24,202
I'm sorry.

680
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,021
Natalia.

681
00:38:27,336 --> 00:38:29,595
Natalia!

682
00:38:54,715 --> 00:38:57,812
Go. Just go.

683
00:38:59,218 --> 00:39:02,387
So many people, and none of them
coming out of the damn temple.

684
00:39:10,712 --> 00:39:12,912
What have you got, Alex?

685
00:39:12,937 --> 00:39:15,907
Is it them? Can you see their faces?

686
00:39:15,932 --> 00:39:18,219
What? Um, no.

687
00:39:20,622 --> 00:39:22,622
It's not even the right
street corner, Alex.

688
00:39:22,647 --> 00:39:24,046
Right.

689
00:39:24,071 --> 00:39:26,071
Sorry.

690
00:39:31,708 --> 00:39:34,743
Sarah.

691
00:39:41,361 --> 00:39:44,214
_

692
00:39:47,415 --> 00:39:48,956
_

693
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:59,634
_

694
00:40:24,602 --> 00:40:26,242
It was you, wasn't it?

695
00:40:26,267 --> 00:40:28,529
In Philadelphia.

696
00:40:28,554 --> 00:40:30,120
Yes.

697
00:40:32,903 --> 00:40:35,054
And now it's time to tell you everything

698
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:37,206
so you understand why.
