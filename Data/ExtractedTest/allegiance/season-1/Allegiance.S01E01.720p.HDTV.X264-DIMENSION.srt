00:00:49,326 --> 00:00:51,893
Ah!

5
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,202
I want to visit.

6
00:01:19,227 --> 00:01:20,793
Isn't there a bring-your-kid-sister day?

7
00:01:20,818 --> 00:01:22,318
Not that they told me about.

8
00:01:22,343 --> 00:01:23,676
What's it like?

9
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:26,201
It's just an office building.
You'd be bored, really.

10
00:01:26,226 --> 00:01:27,376
They tell you to say that, don't they?

11
00:01:28,692 --> 00:01:30,464
Look, I'm here. I gotta
go. I'll call you tonight.

12
00:01:30,489 --> 00:01:31,455
Okay, bye.

13
00:01:40,343 --> 00:01:42,243
Move up. ID please.

14
00:01:42,278 --> 00:01:44,245
Morning.

15
00:02:20,016 --> 00:02:22,083
Excuse me.

16
00:02:22,118 --> 00:02:25,386
My name is Irina Semovetskaya
and I'm a captain in the SVR.

17
00:02:25,421 --> 00:02:27,321
I'm sorry, I don't know what the SVR is.

18
00:02:27,357 --> 00:02:29,423
I work for Directorate S, Department 11.

19
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:31,258
I'm here on a two-week Diplomatic VISA

20
00:02:31,294 --> 00:02:32,870
with the Russian delegation to the U.N.

21
00:02:32,895 --> 00:02:34,361
I report to Genady Isakov

22
00:02:34,397 --> 00:02:36,797
who heads all SVR
operations inside the U.S.

23
00:02:37,035 --> 00:02:38,801
And I know you are Sam Luttrell,

24
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:40,685
CIA Station Chief for New York.

25
00:02:44,107 --> 00:02:47,392
_

26
00:02:47,392 --> 00:02:48,857
_

27
00:02:49,772 --> 00:02:50,804
Hey, Carol.

28
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:52,829
He said to wait in his office.

29
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:08,167
Come on, we're not meeting here.

30
00:03:10,538 --> 00:03:11,937
Where are we going?

31
00:03:11,962 --> 00:03:14,229
You've been requested on the seventh floor.

32
00:03:14,254 --> 00:03:15,219
By whom?

33
00:03:15,244 --> 00:03:17,878
The head of the Clandestine Service.

34
00:03:17,903 --> 00:03:20,036
What? What for?

35
00:03:20,061 --> 00:03:22,361
You'll see.

36
00:03:22,434 --> 00:03:25,536
I read your report on the stock
market flash crash last month.

37
00:03:25,561 --> 00:03:27,161
You assessed that it was caused

38
00:03:27,186 --> 00:03:29,987
by a covert SVR operation to enrich itself.

39
00:03:30,012 --> 00:03:32,146
How did you come up with that thesis?

40
00:03:32,336 --> 00:03:35,070
I tried to find a pattern
that fit all the facts.

41
00:03:35,095 --> 00:03:36,495
Well, you happen to have been right.

42
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,853
How long has he been with us?

43
00:03:37,878 --> 00:03:38,844
Four months.

44
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:40,802
129 days.

45
00:03:40,827 --> 00:03:42,493
Counting this morning.

46
00:03:42,518 --> 00:03:45,286
I have a feeling you're
gonna go far with us, Alex.

47
00:03:45,311 --> 00:03:47,044
Thank you, ma'am.

48
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:50,438
Irina Semovetskaya.

49
00:03:50,473 --> 00:03:52,840
Line SVR officer.

50
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,809
She walked up to our New York station chief

51
00:03:54,844 --> 00:03:56,877
this morning, asking to defect.

52
00:03:56,913 --> 00:03:59,347
She claimed the SVR is
planning an operation to destroy

53
00:03:59,382 --> 00:04:02,116
some piece of critical
infrastructure in the U.S.

54
00:04:02,151 --> 00:04:03,317
And that the collateral damage

55
00:04:03,353 --> 00:04:05,386
could cause significant loss of life.

56
00:04:05,421 --> 00:04:07,054
Our station chief doesn't believe her.

57
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,990
He thinks she's a dangle, and if we bite,

58
00:04:09,025 --> 00:04:11,692
we'll be on the hook for
years of misinformation.

59
00:04:11,728 --> 00:04:14,295
We've set up a secret meet with
her to assess her credibility

60
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:17,398
but operators look at the
world through a particular lens.

61
00:04:17,433 --> 00:04:19,233
I want analyst in the room to look at it

62
00:04:19,268 --> 00:04:20,568
through a different one.

63
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,895
And, most of all, I want
someone she won't know.

64
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,072
Someone she won't know?

65
00:04:25,108 --> 00:04:27,074
SVR knows the identity of all the analysts

66
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,176
who've been working them
for any length of time.

67
00:04:29,212 --> 00:04:30,845
You've only been here four months.

68
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,113
She won't know you yet.

69
00:04:32,148 --> 00:04:33,948
It'll throw her off balance.

70
00:04:33,983 --> 00:04:36,283
Why does C.O.S. New York
think she's a dangle?

71
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:38,419
When he asked why she decided to defect now

72
00:04:38,454 --> 00:04:40,654
she claimed the night before
she was forced to witness

73
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,991
an SVR officer suspected
of treason get fed alive

74
00:04:44,027 --> 00:04:45,726
into a power plant furnace.

75
00:04:45,762 --> 00:04:46,961
Who was the officer?

76
00:04:46,996 --> 00:04:48,195
She didn't know him.

77
00:04:48,231 --> 00:04:50,664
Said they referred to him as Mikhail,

78
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,067
which doesn't narrow it down much.

79
00:04:53,102 --> 00:04:55,336
The Russians did execute
a few traitors like that

80
00:04:55,371 --> 00:04:57,171
in the '50s, but in Russia.

81
00:04:57,206 --> 00:04:58,706
To do that here, inside the U.S.

82
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:00,197
Is incredibly reckless.

83
00:05:00,243 --> 00:05:02,043
On the other hand, if the
SVR was trying to dangle her,

84
00:05:02,078 --> 00:05:03,477
you'd think they come
up with a reason she was

85
00:05:03,513 --> 00:05:05,312
defecting that was
easier for us to swallow.

86
00:05:05,337 --> 00:05:07,871
That's why I want an analyst in the room.

87
00:05:07,917 --> 00:05:09,216
The meeting is tomorrow.

88
00:05:09,252 --> 00:05:11,018
She's being pulled back
to Moscow in three days

89
00:05:11,043 --> 00:05:13,743
and the operation against
us could come at any time.

90
00:05:19,424 --> 00:05:21,525
_

91
00:05:34,977 --> 00:05:36,110
What are you doing?

92
00:05:36,145 --> 00:05:38,212
Making pies.

93
00:05:38,247 --> 00:05:41,916
If your snail-like dad ever
gets back from the fairway.

94
00:05:41,951 --> 00:05:43,048
Why?

95
00:05:43,073 --> 00:05:45,897
For an orthodox celebration
which you wouldn't know about

96
00:05:45,922 --> 00:05:49,390
because you're an atheist and
you have rejected your heritage.

97
00:05:49,425 --> 00:05:51,058
Show me your math homework.

98
00:05:51,094 --> 00:05:52,157
_

99
00:05:52,182 --> 00:05:53,304
_

100
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:54,528
You don't have to check everything.

101
00:05:54,564 --> 00:05:56,864
I do when you're getting
Ds in two subjects.

102
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:58,732
I'm sorry, I'm not a
genius like my brother.

103
00:05:58,768 --> 00:06:00,401
No, he had problems in school, believe me,

104
00:06:00,436 --> 00:06:01,769
but he worked hard to compensate.

105
00:06:01,804 --> 00:06:03,871
Girls aren't even supposed
to be good at math, mom.

106
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:05,272
I was good at math.

107
00:06:05,308 --> 00:06:07,007
Or I never would have
gotten into medical school.

108
00:06:07,043 --> 00:06:08,676
You don't understand.

109
00:06:08,711 --> 00:06:10,711
I don't even want to be a doctor anymore.

110
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,470
Ma'am, could you tell me which one of these

111
00:06:19,495 --> 00:06:20,751
white potatoes is least sweet?

112
00:06:20,776 --> 00:06:21,942
None of them.

113
00:06:22,158 --> 00:06:24,592
Who told you white potatoes were sweet?

114
00:06:24,627 --> 00:06:27,027
A crazy person.

115
00:06:27,063 --> 00:06:30,264
Never mind.

116
00:06:30,299 --> 00:06:32,766
Mom, I have to turn that in fifth period.

117
00:06:32,802 --> 00:06:34,869
Well, it's wrong. You
have do it over at lunch.

118
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:41,075
- Yes?
- Hi, sweetheart.

119
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,711
There are literally 16
varieties of white potatoes here,

120
00:06:43,746 --> 00:06:46,147
and I just talked to a woman,
she said none of them are sweet.

121
00:06:46,182 --> 00:06:47,715
Well, her taste buds are broken.

122
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,116
Well, maybe so, but...

123
00:06:49,152 --> 00:06:51,152
ask someone else, I'm
busy trying to understand

124
00:06:51,187 --> 00:06:53,420
why your daughter doesn't
care about going to college.

125
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:54,522
What?

126
00:07:00,329 --> 00:07:01,295
Hey.

127
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,130
Laratte potatoes, get those.

128
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,799
Uh, yeah, you know what?

129
00:07:05,835 --> 00:07:08,335
They didn't have Laratte potatoes.

130
00:07:08,371 --> 00:07:10,604
You my love, are a shockingly bad liar.

131
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,540
Go back inside and get them.

132
00:07:12,575 --> 00:07:14,254
Right, okay.

133
00:07:21,651 --> 00:07:24,821
_

134
00:07:24,821 --> 00:07:26,264
_

135
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:27,288
What are you doing here?

136
00:07:27,323 --> 00:07:29,123
Work sent me up here for something.

137
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:31,025
Something you can talk about?

138
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,092
Not really.

139
00:07:32,128 --> 00:07:33,961
Oh, mama doesn't like that.

140
00:07:36,132 --> 00:07:37,665
How long are you gonna be in town?

141
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,033
Only just a couple of days.

142
00:07:39,068 --> 00:07:40,367
And you're gonna stay here?

143
00:07:40,403 --> 00:07:42,937
Mm, they want me at a hotel in the city.

144
00:07:42,972 --> 00:07:45,406
How about dinner? I made pierogi.

145
00:07:45,441 --> 00:07:47,074
Oh, not tonight, mom.

146
00:07:47,109 --> 00:07:48,742
But I think I can come
by tomorrow and watch

147
00:07:48,778 --> 00:07:51,445
the final four with dad.

148
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,047
What about me?

149
00:07:53,082 --> 00:07:54,315
You can watch too.

150
00:07:56,252 --> 00:07:57,785
Uh, listen, I need to borrow one of dad's

151
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,486
ties for my meeting.

152
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,023
How come you didn't just
bring a tie from Washington?

153
00:08:03,059 --> 00:08:04,191
Well, I...

154
00:08:04,227 --> 00:08:05,926
I gave you four ties for Christmas.

155
00:08:05,962 --> 00:08:08,596
No, I know, I just... I never
need to wear them for work.

156
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:10,631
Did you throw them away?

157
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,666
I donated them, mom.

158
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,374
Do you need my help?

159
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:23,410
Okay, just work your steps.

160
00:08:25,681 --> 00:08:27,181
Good.

161
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:18,198
Hey.

162
00:09:18,234 --> 00:09:20,567
Hey, Alex is in town for work.

163
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:22,970
He came by to surprise
us. You just missed him.

164
00:09:23,005 --> 00:09:24,937
Really? That's too bad.

165
00:09:24,962 --> 00:09:26,140
He's coming back tomorrow.

166
00:09:26,175 --> 00:09:27,307
Oh, that's great.

167
00:09:27,343 --> 00:09:29,343
Now who knew shopping
could be so complicated?

168
00:09:29,378 --> 00:09:31,912
I brought the receipt to
prove I got Laratte potatoes.

169
00:09:31,937 --> 00:09:34,740
_

170
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:39,420
Thank you for braving fairway.

171
00:09:39,455 --> 00:09:40,921
Of course.

172
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:44,940
I know you'd rather be
watching your basketball.

173
00:09:44,965 --> 00:09:47,433
Well, you know, the big games
aren't until tomorrow, so...

174
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,758
I'd miss it for you anyway.

175
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:51,298
You mean for my pies.

176
00:10:05,194 --> 00:10:06,655
_

177
00:10:13,255 --> 00:10:15,689
We have to see what he wants.

178
00:10:15,725 --> 00:10:16,990
Okay.

179
00:10:29,405 --> 00:10:32,206
I think I startled her.

180
00:10:32,241 --> 00:10:35,209
Yeah.

181
00:10:35,244 --> 00:10:38,145
It's been a long time, Victor.

182
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,381
We thought maybe you went home.

183
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:43,283
No, no, I'm still around.

184
00:10:43,319 --> 00:10:45,352
Faceless clerk in a little office.

185
00:10:53,763 --> 00:10:55,462
Why are you here?

186
00:10:55,609 --> 00:10:57,742
Can't an old friend stop by?

187
00:10:57,767 --> 00:10:59,767
We are not friends.

188
00:11:07,845 --> 00:11:10,579
How's work?

189
00:11:10,604 --> 00:11:12,604
How are the kids?

190
00:11:14,599 --> 00:11:17,800
Sarah's not studying hard enough I see.

191
00:11:17,825 --> 00:11:20,626
What do you want?

192
00:11:20,651 --> 00:11:23,652
I'm just a messenger, Katya.

193
00:11:23,677 --> 00:11:25,644
Don't get mad at me.

194
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:31,135
Our comrades in Moscow have a task for you.

195
00:11:31,367 --> 00:11:33,200
We don't work for them anymore.

196
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:35,869
We had a deal, Victor.

197
00:11:35,905 --> 00:11:37,371
That was the only reason I did what I did.

198
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:40,507
Well, there is new management.

199
00:11:40,543 --> 00:11:42,075
They don't care about deals made with

200
00:11:42,111 --> 00:11:43,076
the old management.

201
00:11:43,112 --> 00:11:44,411
Whatever it is, we won't do it.

202
00:11:44,447 --> 00:11:46,480
It's been six years. Why
are you coming back now?

203
00:11:46,515 --> 00:11:48,849
Because this mission has to be successful.

204
00:11:48,884 --> 00:11:50,384
It's the only thing Moscow cares about,

205
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:53,287
and you are the only
people who can pull it off.

206
00:11:53,322 --> 00:11:55,789
Pull what off?

207
00:11:55,825 --> 00:11:57,862
Recruiting your son to spy for us.

208
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:00,227
Go to hell.

209
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:01,695
We all will if you fail Katya.

210
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,574
How can Alex matter to Moscow?

211
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:05,933
He's a baby analyst. He
just finished his training.

212
00:12:05,968 --> 00:12:08,368
Apparently, his teachers
thought highly of him.

213
00:12:08,404 --> 00:12:10,437
His first assignment was to
the counter-intelligence unit

214
00:12:10,472 --> 00:12:12,139
tracking the SVR.

215
00:12:15,031 --> 00:12:18,378
Alex... He's really flourished, hasn't he?

216
00:12:18,414 --> 00:12:21,748
I know how worried about him
you were when he was younger.

217
00:12:21,784 --> 00:12:23,684
We all were.

218
00:12:25,988 --> 00:12:29,823
Yesterday, Alex was put onto a
case which has the potential to

219
00:12:29,859 --> 00:12:32,793
unravel every single operation
the SVR has in America.

220
00:12:32,828 --> 00:12:34,395
The same case he was referring to

221
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,996
when he stopped by 15 minutes ago

222
00:12:36,031 --> 00:12:39,133
and said work sent him
up here for something.

223
00:12:39,168 --> 00:12:42,569
How can one case be that threatening?

224
00:12:42,605 --> 00:12:45,439
An SVR defector was caught
last week and dealt with

225
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:47,241
here on U.S. soil.

226
00:12:47,276 --> 00:12:49,410
Shortly after he was executed,

227
00:12:49,445 --> 00:12:51,370
we discovered that the man had
stolen hundreds of thousands

228
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,962
of computer files he wasn't
even supposed to have access to,

229
00:12:54,016 --> 00:12:55,449
and hid them somewhere.

230
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:57,251
Files that reveal the identities of every

231
00:12:57,286 --> 00:13:00,387
SVR officer and asset in United States.

232
00:13:00,423 --> 00:13:02,222
Including you.

233
00:13:02,258 --> 00:13:04,692
Would be ironic, wouldn't it,

234
00:13:04,727 --> 00:13:07,194
if your son's investigation
led to his own parents

235
00:13:07,229 --> 00:13:09,263
and older sister being
unmasked as Russian spies?

236
00:13:09,298 --> 00:13:10,631
You don't understand Alex.

237
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,733
He'll go to the FBI. He'll turn us in.

238
00:13:12,768 --> 00:13:14,401
You underestimate the bonds of family.

239
00:13:14,437 --> 00:13:16,036
Whatever bonds exist will be broken

240
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:18,245
the moment he finds out who we are.

241
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,708
Then you're stuck.

242
00:13:20,152 --> 00:13:21,685
Because if we can't stay
one step ahead of the

243
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:25,140
FBI investigation, he's going
to find out who you are anyway.

244
00:13:25,165 --> 00:13:27,666
There is really only one way out of this...

245
00:13:27,691 --> 00:13:32,661
you turn your son into a spy.

246
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:35,687
Have a plan for me to approve
by 8:00 A.M. tomorrow morning.

247
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,761
I'm sure you remember our
communication protocols.

248
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,035
The stakes for all of us...

249
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,971
They couldn't be higher.

250
00:13:51,006 --> 00:13:53,006
Trust me.

251
00:14:33,493 --> 00:14:34,625
Katya.

252
00:14:34,661 --> 00:14:37,595
Katya.

253
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:40,131
I ruined his whole childhood. Now this.

254
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:43,000
No, no one's at fault.

255
00:14:43,136 --> 00:14:44,268
Let's just talk about our options.

256
00:14:44,304 --> 00:14:45,837
No, no, we don't have any options.

257
00:14:45,872 --> 00:14:47,678
You know what we have to do.

258
00:14:49,478 --> 00:14:51,411
I have an appointment with Mr. Edelson.

259
00:14:51,436 --> 00:14:53,436
I'm Bill Adams.

260
00:15:02,388 --> 00:15:04,355
Alex O'Connor.

261
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,157
That's your real name.

262
00:15:06,192 --> 00:15:07,525
Yes.

263
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,626
You're Bill Adams.

264
00:15:08,661 --> 00:15:10,728
Don't use your real name with me.

265
00:15:10,763 --> 00:15:12,496
But you already know it.

266
00:15:12,532 --> 00:15:16,244
If you use it with me, you'll
use it with Semovetskaya.

267
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:18,636
If she's a dangle, she's
learned something about you.

268
00:15:18,671 --> 00:15:20,671
You're Bill Adams.

269
00:15:22,642 --> 00:15:25,109
You've never been involved
in an operation before?

270
00:15:25,144 --> 00:15:26,344
No.

271
00:15:26,379 --> 00:15:28,713
Great.

272
00:15:31,684 --> 00:15:35,119
The meet is in two hours.
Debriefings work on details.

273
00:15:35,154 --> 00:15:37,288
That's how you trip up
someone trying to lie to you.

274
00:15:37,323 --> 00:15:39,290
Her file is on the computer next door.

275
00:15:39,325 --> 00:15:40,958
I read it already.

276
00:15:40,994 --> 00:15:42,326
It's 400 pages.

277
00:15:42,362 --> 00:15:44,862
406... And 1/4.

278
00:15:44,897 --> 00:15:45,896
I'm a fast reader.

279
00:15:45,932 --> 00:15:47,264
Really?

280
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,301
And just how many details did
you retain reading that fast?

281
00:15:50,336 --> 00:15:53,738
All of them.

282
00:15:53,773 --> 00:15:55,506
Go to the conference room.

283
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,541
I'll send the FBI lead in to meet you.

284
00:15:58,554 --> 00:15:59,519
Uh, where's the...

285
00:15:59,544 --> 00:16:01,911
down the hall to the left.

286
00:16:05,418 --> 00:16:08,019
Other way.

287
00:16:16,496 --> 00:16:17,995
- Fill her up?
- Yeah, please, thanks.

288
00:16:18,031 --> 00:16:21,332
- Car wash?
- If I can stay in the car.

289
00:16:21,367 --> 00:16:23,367
If you want.

290
00:16:27,407 --> 00:16:29,874
- Julia Marcus.
- Bill Adams.

291
00:16:29,909 --> 00:16:32,043
Okay, Alex. You armed?

292
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:33,277
Uh, excuse me?

293
00:16:33,312 --> 00:16:35,946
CIA officers can't carry
a weapon inside the U.S.

294
00:16:35,982 --> 00:16:37,248
Unless we go through paperwork

295
00:16:37,283 --> 00:16:39,517
and put you under FBI authority.

296
00:16:39,552 --> 00:16:40,551
That's the law.

297
00:16:40,586 --> 00:16:42,253
I'm not armed. I'm an analyst.

298
00:16:42,288 --> 00:16:43,254
Oh.

299
00:16:43,289 --> 00:16:45,589
- They sent me because I speak Russian.
- _

300
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,258
That's a pretty good accent
for a non-native speaker.

301
00:16:47,293 --> 00:16:48,926
I don't need you to tell
me that my Russian's good.

302
00:16:48,961 --> 00:16:49,994
I didn't mean...

303
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:51,195
We're not using Russian anyway.

304
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:52,930
We'll be interviewing her in English.

305
00:16:52,965 --> 00:16:55,366
It's harder to lie in your second language.

306
00:16:55,401 --> 00:16:57,401
You're ready in five.

307
00:16:59,038 --> 00:17:01,806
Saturday, when he comes over
to watch the games with you.

308
00:17:01,841 --> 00:17:03,507
How much should we tell him?

309
00:17:03,543 --> 00:17:05,009
Why don't we start with the truth?

310
00:17:05,044 --> 00:17:08,596
Your business trips to Moscow,
I was tasked to recruit you,

311
00:17:08,621 --> 00:17:11,415
you refused, but we fell in love anyway.

312
00:17:11,451 --> 00:17:13,584
And do we tell him the
KGB let you leave Russia

313
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:16,420
and marry me as long as you
kept spying for them in the U.S.?

314
00:17:16,456 --> 00:17:17,521
Yes.

315
00:17:20,026 --> 00:17:22,593
Susan Cartwell. Unit 3217.

316
00:17:24,297 --> 00:17:26,797
And when he asks what you did?

317
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,099
Just support.

318
00:17:28,134 --> 00:17:31,168
He has to think it was minor, very minor.

319
00:17:44,917 --> 00:17:46,150
Had the, uh, full service wash.

320
00:17:46,185 --> 00:17:47,418
Mm-hmm.

321
00:17:47,453 --> 00:17:49,286
And I'm gonna take four
of those prepaid phones.

322
00:17:49,322 --> 00:17:50,321
Okay.

323
00:18:04,385 --> 00:18:06,251
Miles.

324
00:18:06,506 --> 00:18:08,105
Kind of blue.

325
00:18:08,141 --> 00:18:09,273
Ice cube.

326
00:18:09,308 --> 00:18:11,075
Death certificate.

327
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,977
Dexter Gordon.

328
00:18:13,012 --> 00:18:15,179
Daddy plays the horn.

329
00:18:15,214 --> 00:18:16,447
Wow.

330
00:18:23,656 --> 00:18:24,622
What's up?

331
00:18:24,657 --> 00:18:26,624
It's my little sister.

332
00:18:26,659 --> 00:18:30,294
I forgot I promised to
pick her up from school.

333
00:18:30,329 --> 00:18:32,496
Sorry, um...

334
00:18:32,532 --> 00:18:34,365
See you later.

335
00:18:36,569 --> 00:18:39,236
Don't take your sunglasses off.

336
00:18:39,272 --> 00:18:41,138
How could you even see
that? You're in front of me.

337
00:18:41,174 --> 00:18:44,308
You just focus on keeping
your sunglasses on your face.

338
00:18:46,078 --> 00:18:48,212
Keep your head down. Don't
look anyone in the eye.

339
00:18:48,247 --> 00:18:50,714
Don't do anything distinct
that you can be remembered by.

340
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,627
Follow my lead and try
not to get in the way.

341
00:18:52,652 --> 00:18:54,018
I'll go wherever you want.

342
00:18:54,053 --> 00:18:55,352
Just put me where you want me.

343
00:18:55,388 --> 00:18:56,820
I want you on the next train back to DC,

344
00:18:56,856 --> 00:18:58,856
but it's not my choice to make.

345
00:19:09,969 --> 00:19:11,735
You can take those sunglasses off now.

346
00:19:11,771 --> 00:19:13,771
Sorry. Sorry.

347
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,800
Ma'am, this way, please.

348
00:19:50,643 --> 00:19:52,510
You set all this up in 24 hours?

349
00:19:52,545 --> 00:19:55,946
Good operators move as fast
as the tasking requires.

350
00:20:02,088 --> 00:20:03,988
In here.

351
00:20:04,199 --> 00:20:06,300
Captain Semovetskaya, this is special...

352
00:20:06,325 --> 00:20:08,002
I know who she is.

353
00:20:08,027 --> 00:20:09,737
I need to be back in two hours,

354
00:20:09,761 --> 00:20:11,683
or my people will start
to wonder where I went.

355
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,403
Okay, the more specific you are

356
00:20:13,428 --> 00:20:16,339
the easier it will be for
us to confirm your story.

357
00:20:16,364 --> 00:20:17,897
Please have a seat.

358
00:20:17,922 --> 00:20:19,938
Why don't we start with Wednesday night?

359
00:20:21,884 --> 00:20:24,790
We were driven from
Manhattan in windowless vans.

360
00:20:24,815 --> 00:20:27,215
Two-hour drive, but we could
have been driving in circles

361
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,939
and we wouldn't know.

362
00:20:28,964 --> 00:20:31,759
When they opened the van doors,
we were already inside a garage,

363
00:20:31,784 --> 00:20:34,891
so I couldn't see any of the
landscape around the plant.

364
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:37,517
We go into hiding,
abroad. We leave tonight.

365
00:20:37,542 --> 00:20:38,808
Tonight?

366
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,935
Victor expects to be vetting
a plan to recruit Alex

367
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,826
tomorrow at 8:00 A.M..
It has to be tonight.

368
00:20:42,862 --> 00:20:44,027
I have a life here, mom.

369
00:20:44,063 --> 00:20:45,596
You can build a life somewhere else.

370
00:20:45,631 --> 00:20:48,832
As long as they can get to us,
they have leverage to turn Alex.

371
00:20:48,868 --> 00:20:50,905
- So what, do we just...
- Vanish?

372
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,063
And leave Alex?

373
00:20:52,088 --> 00:20:55,156
Once we're safe, we make contact with him.

374
00:20:55,181 --> 00:20:56,281
And say what?

375
00:20:56,306 --> 00:20:58,473
We tell him the truth then.

376
00:21:00,746 --> 00:21:02,946
You move heaven and earth for Alex.

377
00:21:02,982 --> 00:21:04,414
What did you ever do for me?

378
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,250
No, it was too late with you.

379
00:21:06,285 --> 00:21:07,388
Too late?

380
00:21:07,413 --> 00:21:09,666
You practically turned me over to Victor.

381
00:21:09,691 --> 00:21:11,190
You didn't put up much of a fight.

382
00:21:11,215 --> 00:21:12,833
- I was a kid!
- When are you going to learn

383
00:21:12,858 --> 00:21:15,789
to take responsibility
for your own actions?

384
00:21:16,194 --> 00:21:17,994
Maybe when you do, mom.

385
00:21:18,163 --> 00:21:19,663
I was 20 years old.

386
00:21:19,698 --> 00:21:21,789
Well, I was 17

387
00:21:22,001 --> 00:21:24,234
when my father summoned me back to Russia

388
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,756
to tell me that he was a KGB general

389
00:21:26,781 --> 00:21:28,947
and it was time for me
to do my patriotic duty,

390
00:21:28,972 --> 00:21:30,855
which I did.

391
00:21:30,961 --> 00:21:35,355
And still, I accept that as a choice.

392
00:21:35,885 --> 00:21:37,685
One that I have carried the burden of

393
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:40,755
every day since I made it.

394
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:45,689
We're gonna keep running
for the rest of our lives.

395
00:21:45,724 --> 00:21:48,625
- Until they find us.
- They won't.

396
00:21:48,661 --> 00:21:50,245
Not where we're going.

397
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:53,510
As he was rolled toward the
furnace, he was screaming.

398
00:21:53,532 --> 00:21:55,363
He tried to make a last-minute deal,

399
00:21:55,388 --> 00:21:57,444
claiming he has stolen more
secrets than they realized,

400
00:21:57,469 --> 00:21:59,303
that he had information to trade.

401
00:21:59,338 --> 00:22:01,661
But the rezident didn't care.

402
00:22:01,686 --> 00:22:04,754
As his feet went into the fire,
Mikhail shouted at the rezident,

403
00:22:04,779 --> 00:22:07,146
"I'll haunt you from the grave."

404
00:22:07,171 --> 00:22:09,004
Then as his whole body burst into flames,

405
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:12,161
he yelled out to God, "Isus vaskres!"

406
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:15,180
The rezident had him pulled
out, sprayed with a fire hose,

407
00:22:15,205 --> 00:22:16,252
but it was too late.

408
00:22:16,277 --> 00:22:18,010
Why did the rezident do that?

409
00:22:18,035 --> 00:22:21,569
I don't know... maybe he
thought last-minute compassion

410
00:22:21,594 --> 00:22:23,527
would keep him out of hell.

411
00:22:23,562 --> 00:22:25,796
He probably just wanted to keep him alive

412
00:22:25,821 --> 00:22:27,125
so he could keep the torture going.

413
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:29,610
Let's go back to a
description of the power plant.

414
00:22:29,635 --> 00:22:30,934
I don't know what else to say.

415
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:31,935
How old was the equipment?

416
00:22:31,971 --> 00:22:33,236
I don't know how to assess that.

417
00:22:33,272 --> 00:22:34,474
How did you first hear about

418
00:22:34,499 --> 00:22:36,332
the operation you mentioned to me?

419
00:22:36,357 --> 00:22:40,025
An SVR officer by the name of Oleg Zhulov.

420
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,416
He was a drunken boast.

421
00:22:41,441 --> 00:22:43,941
He's been trying to get
me into bed for a decade.

422
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:45,925
He said he was close to
launching an operation

423
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,950
that would bring America to its knees.

424
00:22:53,396 --> 00:22:55,096
Africa or south America?

425
00:22:55,121 --> 00:22:56,854
World tour. We need it all.

426
00:22:56,879 --> 00:22:58,879
Oh, okay.

427
00:23:02,853 --> 00:23:05,154
Mrs. Cartwell, you might want
to go grab a cup of coffee.

428
00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:07,580
It's gonna take me about a
half an hour to fill these.

429
00:23:07,605 --> 00:23:09,238
- I'll wait.
- Okay.

430
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:11,397
What she's told us so far
checks out, but it's almost

431
00:23:11,422 --> 00:23:12,922
all information we already had.

432
00:23:12,947 --> 00:23:15,456
She doesn't know who was
executed, where it took place,

433
00:23:15,481 --> 00:23:17,547
or any details about
this supposed operation

434
00:23:17,572 --> 00:23:18,804
that's gonna hit us so hard.

435
00:23:18,829 --> 00:23:20,695
- My gut is still she's lying.
- Mine too.

436
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,052
If I can talk to her,

437
00:23:22,077 --> 00:23:24,626
I can give you a definitive answer.

438
00:23:24,651 --> 00:23:26,150
Who is this guy?

439
00:23:32,467 --> 00:23:34,267
Captain, I'd like to ask
you a few more questions

440
00:23:34,292 --> 00:23:35,959
about the physical
environment of the power plant.

441
00:23:35,984 --> 00:23:37,517
Your colleagues already asked me dozens

442
00:23:37,542 --> 00:23:39,742
of questions that I couldn't answer.

443
00:23:39,767 --> 00:23:41,081
Well, my questions will be easier.

444
00:23:41,106 --> 00:23:42,739
They're multiple choice.

445
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:47,984
Which of the four photographs
looks like the furnace you saw?

446
00:23:53,778 --> 00:23:56,746
Were the sides of the
furnace brick or metal?

447
00:23:56,771 --> 00:23:58,337
Brick.

448
00:23:58,362 --> 00:24:00,695
Yellow brick.

449
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,453
It's a squash ball.

450
00:24:02,478 --> 00:24:04,579
You mentioned steam
escaping from some pipes.

451
00:24:04,604 --> 00:24:06,938
Were those above the
furnaces or at the sides?

452
00:24:06,963 --> 00:24:10,198
Neither. It was from the
floor, underneath the furnaces.

453
00:24:10,296 --> 00:24:13,454
_

454
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:15,628
_

455
00:24:15,907 --> 00:24:19,137
_

456
00:24:21,814 --> 00:24:22,913
I'm going to play you recordings

457
00:24:22,948 --> 00:24:24,448
of three kinds of machinery.

458
00:24:24,483 --> 00:24:25,749
Tell what you heard that night.

459
00:24:33,325 --> 00:24:35,325
You prepped all that in 24 hours?

460
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,229
Good analysts move as fast
as the tasking requires.

461
00:24:39,264 --> 00:24:41,565
I don't think the execution
took place in a power plant.

462
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,133
Every answer she gave was consistent

463
00:24:43,168 --> 00:24:44,201
with a steam-generating plant,

464
00:24:44,226 --> 00:24:46,806
specifically one built
between 1925 and 1939.

465
00:24:46,831 --> 00:24:48,438
She's been inside one, or she
never could have done that.

466
00:24:48,474 --> 00:24:50,807
That doesn't establish that
an execution took place there.

467
00:24:50,843 --> 00:24:53,777
No, Sir, but while there are
more than 300 steam generation

468
00:24:53,812 --> 00:24:55,579
plants within a two-hour
drive of Manhattan,

469
00:24:55,614 --> 00:24:59,216
there are only 19 that were
built between 1925 and 1939.

470
00:24:59,251 --> 00:25:00,751
If the Bureau sends agents out to each one

471
00:25:00,786 --> 00:25:02,419
armed with the layout
she drew of the plant,

472
00:25:02,454 --> 00:25:04,054
they should be able to
identify the one she was in

473
00:25:04,089 --> 00:25:06,252
and find evidence to the murder.

474
00:25:13,966 --> 00:25:16,800
I hate this time of year, don't you?

475
00:25:16,836 --> 00:25:19,069
It gets dark so early.

476
00:25:19,105 --> 00:25:22,573
It's cold all the time.

477
00:25:22,608 --> 00:25:25,743
We are Russian... we're
genetically adapted for that.

478
00:25:25,778 --> 00:25:30,247
Still, perfect time of year to get away.

479
00:25:30,282 --> 00:25:32,049
Somewhere tropical.

480
00:25:33,552 --> 00:25:35,986
Answer it.

481
00:25:36,021 --> 00:25:38,088
It's your husband.

482
00:25:38,124 --> 00:25:40,924
I think there's a problem
with your credit card.

483
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,846
Plane tickets... I think they
were cancelled for non-payment.

484
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,716
_

485
00:25:48,843 --> 00:25:50,942
_

486
00:25:53,239 --> 00:25:55,472
I understand you trying to protect him.

487
00:25:55,508 --> 00:25:58,108
It's maternal instinct.

488
00:25:58,144 --> 00:25:59,743
And of course, you carry around such guilt

489
00:25:59,779 --> 00:26:01,412
about his early years.

490
00:26:01,447 --> 00:26:03,981
But don't let any of that obscure your duty

491
00:26:04,016 --> 00:26:07,084
to protect the rest of your family.

492
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:08,352
Sarah for example.

493
00:26:08,387 --> 00:26:10,387
Don't you dare.

494
00:26:14,165 --> 00:26:17,039
_

495
00:26:17,064 --> 00:26:19,742
_

496
00:26:19,767 --> 00:26:22,391
_

497
00:26:43,358 --> 00:26:44,600
_

498
00:26:44,631 --> 00:26:47,155
Mikhail shouted at the rezident,
"I'll haunt you from the grave."

499
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,913
Then as his whole body burst into flames,

500
00:26:48,938 --> 00:26:51,872
he yelled out to God, "Isus vaskres!"

501
00:26:51,897 --> 00:26:52,896
The rezide...

502
00:26:56,044 --> 00:26:57,277
Irina said Mikhail was screaming,

503
00:26:57,312 --> 00:26:58,712
trying to make a last-minute deal,

504
00:26:58,747 --> 00:27:01,514
claiming he'd stolen more
secrets than the SVR knew about.

505
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,016
She assumed he was doing whatever he needed

506
00:27:03,051 --> 00:27:04,751
to save his life, but what if he really did

507
00:27:04,786 --> 00:27:06,089
steal more secrets than they thought?

508
00:27:06,114 --> 00:27:08,432
I think Isakov realized
this at the last minute,

509
00:27:08,457 --> 00:27:10,223
and that's why he ordered
the hoses turned on.

510
00:27:10,258 --> 00:27:11,791
Hard to believe Isakov wouldn't have known

511
00:27:11,827 --> 00:27:13,126
before walking in.

512
00:27:13,161 --> 00:27:14,427
How long did it take for us to figure out

513
00:27:14,463 --> 00:27:16,463
how much Snowden took?

514
00:27:17,132 --> 00:27:18,665
Why'd he change his
mind at the last second,

515
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,033
with Mikhail already on fire?

516
00:27:20,068 --> 00:27:23,269
Because of what Mikhail
shouted with his dying breath.

517
00:27:23,305 --> 00:27:25,605
He yelled out to God, "Isus vaskres."

518
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,607
- Isus vaskres.
- "Jesus lives."

519
00:27:27,642 --> 00:27:29,976
That's a literal translation,
but outside of a church service

520
00:27:30,012 --> 00:27:31,711
it's basically like saying "happy Easter."

521
00:27:31,747 --> 00:27:33,480
I don't think he meant it that way.

522
00:27:33,507 --> 00:27:35,727
Do you know what an Easter
egg is in the Internet,

523
00:27:35,752 --> 00:27:36,816
or computer context?

524
00:27:36,852 --> 00:27:38,237
A hidden digital cache.

525
00:27:38,262 --> 00:27:39,763
Mikhail's screaming out that
he'd stolen more than they

526
00:27:39,788 --> 00:27:41,287
realized, he's trying to make a deal,

527
00:27:41,323 --> 00:27:43,707
then he says he's gonna haunt
Isakov from beyond the grave,

528
00:27:43,732 --> 00:27:45,025
and his dying words are
essentially "happy Easter"?

529
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,693
I think there's a trove of information

530
00:27:46,728 --> 00:27:48,194
vital to the SVR still out there.

531
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:50,262
Maybe if we can figure out who Mikhail was,

532
00:27:50,287 --> 00:27:52,320
we can find it before the Russians do.

533
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:00,436
You okay?

534
00:28:02,611 --> 00:28:04,344
How did Victor find out?

535
00:28:04,379 --> 00:28:05,378
I don't know.

536
00:28:11,728 --> 00:28:15,130
They think we have too
much to lose to fight back.

537
00:28:15,155 --> 00:28:17,155
They're right.

538
00:28:20,296 --> 00:28:22,296
They can't have another
one of our children.

539
00:28:35,329 --> 00:28:37,029
Katya!

540
00:28:37,054 --> 00:28:38,954
Katya!

541
00:28:38,979 --> 00:28:40,612
Katya. Katya.

542
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:41,937
Where are you going?

543
00:28:41,962 --> 00:28:43,729
Katya, what are you doing?

544
00:28:43,754 --> 00:28:46,263
The only way I have left to protect my home

545
00:28:46,288 --> 00:28:47,820
is to burn theirs down.

546
00:28:47,856 --> 00:28:49,350
I'm going to the FBI.

547
00:28:49,375 --> 00:28:52,081
No, no, Katya! Katya, no!

548
00:29:16,985 --> 00:29:18,985
Dammit. Your call has been for...

549
00:29:21,404 --> 00:29:23,356
Come on!

550
00:29:26,695 --> 00:29:28,294
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

551
00:29:36,772 --> 00:29:37,737
Hey.

552
00:29:37,773 --> 00:29:39,005
Call mom.

553
00:29:39,041 --> 00:29:40,874
- What's wrong?
- She's gone crazy.

554
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:43,176
- That's nothing new.
- She's turning herself in.

555
00:29:43,211 --> 00:29:44,244
How's that for new?

556
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:47,070
- What?
- Call her.

557
00:29:56,258 --> 00:29:57,223
I'm sorry.

558
00:29:57,259 --> 00:29:58,491
Mom, what the hell are you doing?

559
00:29:58,527 --> 00:29:59,433
I love you.

560
00:29:59,458 --> 00:30:01,152
_

561
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:16,259
Nice job in there.

562
00:30:16,284 --> 00:30:17,506
Thanks.

563
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,699
Come on, let's go.

564
00:31:14,136 --> 00:31:15,268
Pull over!

565
00:31:15,303 --> 00:31:17,137
Pull over!

566
00:31:34,076 --> 00:31:35,809
Katya.

567
00:31:36,024 --> 00:31:37,290
Katya, do you think this
is going to save Alex?

568
00:31:37,325 --> 00:31:38,358
This is going to ruin him.

569
00:31:38,393 --> 00:31:39,859
He'll be the son of Russian spies,

570
00:31:39,895 --> 00:31:41,972
he'll lose his job,
his friends, his family.

571
00:31:41,997 --> 00:31:43,073
He'll hate you forever.

572
00:31:43,098 --> 00:31:44,263
He is going to find out anyway.

573
00:31:44,299 --> 00:31:45,832
I'd rather he find out this way.

574
00:31:45,867 --> 00:31:48,368
In time he's gonna understand
that I did this to protect him.

575
00:31:48,403 --> 00:31:49,894
What about Natalie? What about me?

576
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,719
You weren't involved. You were unwitting.

577
00:31:51,744 --> 00:31:53,044
That's what I'm going to tell them.

578
00:31:53,069 --> 00:31:54,802
I'm a senior executive at the biggest

579
00:31:54,827 --> 00:31:56,260
defense contractor in the country.

580
00:31:56,285 --> 00:31:57,250
You don't think the FBI is smart

581
00:31:57,275 --> 00:31:58,240
enough to connect the dots?

582
00:31:58,265 --> 00:31:59,597
There aren't any dots to connect.

583
00:31:59,622 --> 00:32:00,854
We were very careful about that.

584
00:32:00,879 --> 00:32:03,052
You deny any knowledge and you go back

585
00:32:03,077 --> 00:32:04,443
to living your life.

586
00:32:04,468 --> 00:32:05,755
My life...

587
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:08,681
My life is with you, Katya!

588
00:32:08,832 --> 00:32:12,701
What kind of life do you
think I'd be going back to?

589
00:32:12,814 --> 00:32:16,349
I committed treason
against the country I love

590
00:32:16,374 --> 00:32:18,241
so we could be together.

591
00:32:18,266 --> 00:32:21,768
As a couple, as a family.

592
00:32:21,793 --> 00:32:25,328
Please, tell me I didn't
do all this for nothing.

593
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,500
I won't give him up.

594
00:32:42,491 --> 00:32:44,724
- Maybe there's another way.
- What?

595
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,059
We get what they want

596
00:32:46,405 --> 00:32:47,771
- ourselves.
- How?

597
00:32:47,796 --> 00:32:49,228
From Alex.

598
00:32:49,264 --> 00:32:52,732
Without him knowing.

599
00:32:52,767 --> 00:32:54,222
We spy on our own son?

600
00:32:54,247 --> 00:32:56,314
We do nothing, he finds out anyway.

601
00:32:56,339 --> 00:32:58,981
We do this, we keep ahead
of the investigation.

602
00:32:59,006 --> 00:33:01,273
We can make anything
disappear that points to us

603
00:33:01,298 --> 00:33:03,198
before he finds it.

604
00:33:06,515 --> 00:33:08,515
Okay?

605
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:14,156
Okay, look, um...

606
00:33:16,473 --> 00:33:18,023
You were driving to
the county clerks office

607
00:33:18,048 --> 00:33:20,448
to file for divorce, I
was trying to stop you.

608
00:33:20,473 --> 00:33:23,040
This is a marital dispute.

609
00:33:23,065 --> 00:33:25,933
We'll get tickets for
the accident, that's it.

610
00:33:25,958 --> 00:33:26,924
Okay.

611
00:33:26,949 --> 00:33:29,250
Tears would help sell it.

612
00:33:29,275 --> 00:33:30,574
Officer.

613
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:31,898
Sir.

614
00:33:31,923 --> 00:33:33,856
Ma'am is everything all right?

615
00:33:33,881 --> 00:33:35,681
Everything's fine.

616
00:33:44,661 --> 00:33:45,794
Victor.

617
00:33:46,245 --> 00:33:48,456
_

618
00:33:48,481 --> 00:33:49,547
_

619
00:33:49,572 --> 00:33:52,907
Enough, stop please. Both of you.

620
00:33:52,932 --> 00:33:55,205
Victor, we're here to talk
to you as a professional.

621
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,406
Now you know Alex, you've
known him since he's a kid.

622
00:33:58,842 --> 00:34:01,243
You know how different he is.

623
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:03,155
You have to realize how crazy the risks

624
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,134
are in trying to recruit him.

625
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:05,725
Moscow doesn't care.

626
00:34:09,456 --> 00:34:13,558
What if we can get whatever
they're after directly?

627
00:34:13,859 --> 00:34:14,825
What do you mean?

628
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,683
He trusts us.

629
00:34:16,708 --> 00:34:20,643
We have access to his car,
his phone, his computer.

630
00:34:20,668 --> 00:34:22,435
We're the perfect people to spy on him.

631
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,393
We can get whatever you get.

632
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:26,730
With no risk.

633
00:34:26,755 --> 00:34:28,755
Just give us 24 hours.

634
00:34:36,588 --> 00:34:38,588
Alex is here!

635
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,114
_

636
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:46,607
I missed you too.

637
00:34:47,891 --> 00:34:49,133
I didn't think you were home yet.

638
00:34:49,158 --> 00:34:50,117
I didn't see your car out there.

639
00:34:50,143 --> 00:34:51,542
Oh, it's in the shop.

640
00:34:51,567 --> 00:34:52,999
She drove into dad.

641
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:54,223
What?

642
00:34:54,248 --> 00:34:55,247
Yeah.

643
00:34:55,272 --> 00:34:57,105
He cut me off.

644
00:34:57,411 --> 00:34:58,544
Thank you.

645
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,160
Marital dispute.

646
00:35:02,671 --> 00:35:03,770
Over what?

647
00:35:04,118 --> 00:35:05,084
I don't know.

648
00:35:05,109 --> 00:35:07,543
Mom's a spaz, and dad enables her.

649
00:35:07,568 --> 00:35:08,533
Could have been anything.

650
00:35:08,558 --> 00:35:09,823
Enables her?

651
00:35:09,848 --> 00:35:12,515
You meeting now at Al-anon
meetings or something?

652
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,072
What's Al-anon?

653
00:35:14,097 --> 00:35:15,630
Al-anon is...

654
00:35:17,146 --> 00:35:18,346
Oh, look who showed up.

655
00:35:18,551 --> 00:35:20,084
I thought silicon alley demanded you work

656
00:35:20,109 --> 00:35:20,947
late into the night.

657
00:35:20,972 --> 00:35:23,138
I'm that good. They let me leave early.

658
00:35:32,976 --> 00:35:35,510
Hey, the prodigal son returns.

659
00:35:35,535 --> 00:35:37,134
Hey, dad.

660
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:39,126
It's good to see you.

661
00:35:39,223 --> 00:35:40,356
You gonna spend the night?

662
00:35:40,381 --> 00:35:42,114
Yeah, we never get to see you.

663
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:43,135
That is true.

664
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,959
Uh, I can't tonight.

665
00:35:44,982 --> 00:35:46,715
My clothes are at the hotel.

666
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:49,184
Plus somebody snagged my room, I believe.

667
00:35:49,219 --> 00:35:50,919
Oh, she's done a wonderful job.

668
00:35:50,954 --> 00:35:52,854
A lot more colorful.

669
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:54,856
Oh, no, don't tell me it's pink.

670
00:36:03,877 --> 00:36:06,559
_

671
00:36:06,584 --> 00:36:10,058
_

672
00:36:16,535 --> 00:36:18,283
_

673
00:36:18,308 --> 00:36:23,261
_

674
00:36:23,406 --> 00:36:25,061
_

675
00:36:26,423 --> 00:36:28,290
I should have told you up front.

676
00:36:28,325 --> 00:36:29,291
He's not recruitable.

677
00:36:29,326 --> 00:36:31,793
Everyone is recruitable, Dobrynin.

678
00:36:31,829 --> 00:36:34,029
With a reliable road map to
the target's psychology... yes.

679
00:36:34,064 --> 00:36:35,764
- So get one.
- It doesn't exist.

680
00:36:35,799 --> 00:36:37,332
The boy's not normal.

681
00:36:37,459 --> 00:36:38,927
_

682
00:36:39,569 --> 00:36:41,498
_

683
00:36:41,822 --> 00:36:44,956
This is a kid who didn't
speak until he was 8 years old.

684
00:36:44,981 --> 00:36:47,647
_

685
00:36:47,741 --> 00:36:50,512
No. When he finally did speak,

686
00:36:50,547 --> 00:36:53,515
it was in complete sentences
with perfect pronunciation.

687
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,883
He could speak all along.

688
00:36:54,918 --> 00:36:56,551
He chose not to.

689
00:36:56,587 --> 00:36:58,587
Why?

690
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,723
Then he couldn't learn to read.

691
00:37:01,758 --> 00:37:03,358
By age 9, the school started saying

692
00:37:03,393 --> 00:37:05,594
he was disabled, mentally.

693
00:37:05,629 --> 00:37:09,330
Then one day, his mom came home
from an operation at 4:00 A.M.

694
00:37:09,355 --> 00:37:11,299
And saw a light coming from his room.

695
00:37:11,335 --> 00:37:14,302
She walked in to find
him reading Anna Karenina.

696
00:37:14,338 --> 00:37:17,005
I don't know what makes
someone like that tick.

697
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,543
But I do know his response
to anything we try on him

698
00:37:21,578 --> 00:37:23,879
will be completely unpredictable.

699
00:37:25,282 --> 00:37:28,056
You have a serious problem.

700
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,753
There's another way to get what they want.

701
00:37:31,788 --> 00:37:34,256
So, how is being a spy?

702
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:35,724
An analyst is not a spy.

703
00:37:35,759 --> 00:37:37,125
You don't have to pretend with me.

704
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,960
I'm your sister.

705
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:41,607
Oh, sorry.

706
00:37:41,632 --> 00:37:43,098
That's mine.

707
00:37:54,545 --> 00:37:55,510
Alex O'Connor.

708
00:37:55,546 --> 00:37:56,778
Hey, it's Julia.

709
00:37:56,813 --> 00:37:58,289
We just found a steam plant
that matches everything

710
00:37:58,314 --> 00:38:00,015
you got from the interview.

711
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:02,083
Pick you up in five.

712
00:38:16,021 --> 00:38:17,622
Hey, how you doing?

713
00:38:17,647 --> 00:38:18,655
Yeah, it's right over that way.

714
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,147
- Okay, thank you.
- Yeah.

715
00:38:21,172 --> 00:38:22,971
Plant was decommissioned a month ago.

716
00:38:22,996 --> 00:38:24,695
Then why was the furnace still warm...

717
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,521
125 minutes ago when
the first agents arrived?

718
00:38:33,448 --> 00:38:35,048
Layout is almost an
exact match of the diagram

719
00:38:35,073 --> 00:38:36,344
Irina drew for us.

720
00:38:40,535 --> 00:38:42,302
Who is it?

721
00:38:42,327 --> 00:38:43,989
_

722
00:38:54,013 --> 00:38:56,941
_

723
00:38:58,723 --> 00:39:00,156
What was that for?

724
00:39:00,246 --> 00:39:03,567
_

725
00:39:03,592 --> 00:39:04,591
Natalie.

726
00:39:06,646 --> 00:39:09,245
_

727
00:39:09,897 --> 00:39:12,264
You may actually be crazier than she is.

728
00:39:12,289 --> 00:39:14,623
Yeah? You think?

729
00:39:23,779 --> 00:39:26,279
We got no witnesses, we
haven't found any evidence,

730
00:39:26,315 --> 00:39:28,315
blood or anything else suggesting a body.

731
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:29,416
Where's your radiography unit?

732
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:31,251
Uh, it's on the truck. Why?

733
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:32,385
To see if any trace evidence

734
00:39:32,421 --> 00:39:33,720
has bonded with the base of the furnace.

735
00:39:33,755 --> 00:39:36,256
If a body was in there,
any evidence of it is gone.

736
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:38,725
That thing burns at over
3,200 degrees Celsius.

737
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,193
That's the maximum
temperature of the furnace,

738
00:39:40,228 --> 00:39:41,394
but on the night of the execution

739
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:43,496
they were running it at
1,400 degrees or less.

740
00:39:43,532 --> 00:39:45,065
Well, how in the hell would you know that?

741
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:48,034
Condensation in the window
of the oxygen regulator.

742
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,383
What?

743
00:39:49,408 --> 00:39:50,941
The maximum hydrocarbon flame temperature

744
00:39:50,966 --> 00:39:53,099
is 3,200 degrees Celsius, but that can only

745
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:54,790
be achieved with pure oxygen combustion.

746
00:39:54,815 --> 00:39:56,519
Condensation on the regulator means

747
00:39:56,544 --> 00:39:58,577
that outside air was freely
mixing the oxygen being

748
00:39:58,613 --> 00:39:59,746
pumped into the furnace.

749
00:39:59,781 --> 00:40:01,381
Now the maximum temperature
of a hydrocarbon flame

750
00:40:01,416 --> 00:40:05,085
in air, which is 78.084%
nitrogen is 1,400 degrees.

751
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,419
Bone would liquefy at that temperature,

752
00:40:06,455 --> 00:40:07,554
but it wouldn't be completely destroyed,

753
00:40:07,589 --> 00:40:09,589
meaning intact DNA.

754
00:40:11,126 --> 00:40:13,693
What are you, a thermochemist?

755
00:40:13,729 --> 00:40:15,261
No.

756
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:21,701
You know, even if you
are smarter than everyone

757
00:40:21,737 --> 00:40:23,870
else, you don't have to let them know it.

758
00:40:23,905 --> 00:40:25,138
What?

759
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:27,207
Social graces?

760
00:40:27,242 --> 00:40:29,743
Um, forget it.

761
00:40:33,058 --> 00:40:35,926
Got a lot of impurities
fused with the furnace base.

762
00:40:35,951 --> 00:40:38,885
This could be your bone tissue here.

763
00:40:38,921 --> 00:40:40,086
Or here.

764
00:40:40,122 --> 00:40:42,289
What's that there?

765
00:40:42,324 --> 00:40:44,991
Can you move around it?

766
00:40:45,027 --> 00:40:47,527
These seem much more sharply
defined than the others.

767
00:40:47,563 --> 00:40:49,763
Non-organic material has higher
kindling and melting points

768
00:40:49,798 --> 00:40:52,532
than organic material does.

769
00:40:52,568 --> 00:40:55,235
Could it be steel?

770
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:58,138
I don't think steel melts
until 1,500 degrees Celsius.

771
00:40:58,173 --> 00:40:59,840
That's true of carbon
steel. Stainless steel

772
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:01,208
melts at a lower temperature.

773
00:41:01,243 --> 00:41:04,377
Why would there be
stainless steel in there?

774
00:41:04,413 --> 00:41:06,313
Mikhail had a knee replacement.

775
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,921
Comms vault just came online,
powers that be are standing by.

776
00:41:14,967 --> 00:41:16,600
Thanks, Pat.

777
00:41:16,625 --> 00:41:19,259
So, you ever been inside of...

778
00:41:19,294 --> 00:41:21,061
Faraday cage before?

779
00:41:21,096 --> 00:41:22,162
No.

780
00:41:26,461 --> 00:41:28,360
All right, boss, I got you live.

781
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:30,585
Mr. Palmer, I got you on as well.

782
00:41:32,007 --> 00:41:34,774
Pretty similar.

783
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:36,776
Our databases should be
able to produce a list

784
00:41:36,812 --> 00:41:39,512
of Mikhails in the SVR
who had knee replacements.

785
00:41:44,362 --> 00:41:45,795
Shouldn't we bring Irina in now

786
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:46,955
and put her under our protection?

787
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:49,947
Not yet. She wants us to get
her family out of Russia first

788
00:41:49,972 --> 00:41:53,306
before she defects so the SVR
doesn't retaliate against them.

789
00:41:53,331 --> 00:41:55,155
We're not putting a protective
surveillance team on her?

790
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,005
We asked. She doesn't want one.

791
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:58,463
She's afraid that her people will spot it

792
00:41:58,495 --> 00:42:00,495
and then know for sure she's a traitor.

793
00:42:02,635 --> 00:42:05,065
So she's just out there? On her own?

794
00:42:20,055 --> 00:42:21,421
Killing a woman on the streets of New York,

795
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:23,757
a half-block from a police station.

796
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:25,792
They must have something
truly vital to protect.

797
00:42:25,827 --> 00:42:28,395
Like an operation to
bring America to its knees?

798
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:29,662
Sir.

799
00:42:29,698 --> 00:42:32,332
Langley has our deceased
narrowed down to one name,

800
00:42:32,367 --> 00:42:33,666
Mikhail Vostrov.

801
00:42:33,702 --> 00:42:36,369
SVR colonel, knee surgery
while stationed in Canada

802
00:42:36,405 --> 00:42:37,804
14 years ago.

803
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:39,839
Profile and a picture
coming up on your screen now.

804
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:55,488
Hello?

805
00:42:59,127 --> 00:43:02,529
Alex, hi.

806
00:43:02,564 --> 00:43:04,064
I remember one time when I was a kid,

807
00:43:04,099 --> 00:43:05,899
you called your childhood friend Nicholai

808
00:43:05,934 --> 00:43:08,334
Mikhail by mistake.

809
00:43:13,375 --> 00:43:15,775
I'll give you two choices.

810
00:43:15,811 --> 00:43:18,645
You can tell me everything
from the beginning,

811
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,680
or I can turn you in.

812
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:24,239
Hey, Alex.

813
00:43:27,055 --> 00:43:28,121
Who died?

814
00:43:54,887 --> 00:43:57,788
