1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,796
Previously on 90210...

2
00:00:01,791 --> 00:00:04,190
Adrianna was so worried this
morning when she saw Vanessa,

3
00:00:04,191 --> 00:00:05,162
she told me everything.

4
00:00:05,201 --> 00:00:07,274
Stop pretending you don't know she's back.

5
00:00:07,266 --> 00:00:08,439
You were on your way to meet her.

6
00:00:08,455 --> 00:00:10,058
<i>I can't let you do that.</i>

7
00:00:10,089 --> 00:00:12,115
You'll be traveling in this.

8
00:00:12,122 --> 00:00:13,006
You're gonna put me in a box?

9
00:00:13,006 --> 00:00:14,312
<i>If you won't let me protect you,</i>

10
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:15,793
you leave me no other choice.

11
00:00:15,806 --> 00:00:17,237
How long have you been staying in L.A.?

12
00:00:17,245 --> 00:00:18,504
I'm just here for a job interview.

13
00:00:18,504 --> 00:00:19,576
So, you're moving here.

14
00:00:19,599 --> 00:00:20,577
I don't know if it's gonna pan out.

15
00:00:20,592 --> 00:00:22,274
I mean, I got to meet you.

16
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,542
I can't take away your
only chance to have a baby.

17
00:00:24,573 --> 00:00:26,536
Mr. Montgomery stipulated
you hire a third party

18
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,787
to carry the child.

19
00:00:27,907 --> 00:00:31,627
There is one other
candidate. Shane has a sister.

20
00:00:31,747 --> 00:00:33,715
You have to be so incredibly brave

21
00:00:33,746 --> 00:00:36,015
to trust somebody you just
met to carry your baby.

22
00:00:36,023 --> 00:00:38,736
I'd really like the
chance to be that person.

23
00:00:38,736 --> 00:00:40,340
- Hey, Silver.
- Hey.

24
00:00:42,225 --> 00:00:45,009
I will do whatever it takes
to get out of your contract

25
00:00:45,002 --> 00:00:47,141
and out of your life.

26
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:50,217
I was going to release you

27
00:00:50,272 --> 00:00:51,993
so you could work with him without me.

28
00:00:51,983 --> 00:00:54,533
I'm done. Okay? You're released.

29
00:01:08,102 --> 00:01:10,071
- Yo.
- Yo.

30
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:13,959
Is there a reason why
you're taking apart my sink?

31
00:01:14,472 --> 00:01:17,499
Annie invested 200 grand
into my record label,

32
00:01:17,512 --> 00:01:19,948
and I spent it all on startup costs.

33
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,254
But then I dropped Ade,
which means I have no artist,

34
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,275
no income, no way to pay my sister back.

35
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:25,557
Since Annie's living here,

36
00:01:25,572 --> 00:01:27,691
I figured I'd fix the
sink so she doesn't think

37
00:01:27,707 --> 00:01:29,523
of her brother as some great, big loser.

38
00:01:29,525 --> 00:01:31,543
Wouldn't it be easier
just to sign a new artist?

39
00:01:31,545 --> 00:01:33,628
No established artist wants
to sign with me right now.

40
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,424
And all the big labels are
taking all the new ones.

41
00:01:35,424 --> 00:01:37,095
So, basically, I'm screwed.

42
00:01:37,334 --> 00:01:38,466
Can I help?

43
00:01:38,468 --> 00:01:39,918
Can you sing?

44
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,636
I meant with the sink.

45
00:01:41,812 --> 00:01:45,009
Yeah, apparently record
labels aren't the only thing

46
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:46,174
I can't figure out. (chuckles)

47
00:01:46,176 --> 00:01:47,856
Hand me that wrench.

48
00:01:47,976 --> 00:01:49,251
Here.

49
00:01:49,489 --> 00:01:51,585
And, uh... here. What are... 

50
00:01:51,705 --> 00:01:53,848
This doesn't even...

51
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:54,920
Whoa-oh.

52
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,753
Is this a subpoena?

53
00:01:56,755 --> 00:01:58,060
Yeah, it's no big deal.

54
00:01:58,048 --> 00:01:59,581
I've got to go to court tomorrow

55
00:01:59,581 --> 00:02:01,558
to testify at Ashley's preliminary hearing.

56
00:02:01,615 --> 00:02:03,874
You're testifying against
the lady that kidnapped you?

57
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:05,675
That's kind of heavy.

58
00:02:05,674 --> 00:02:06,995
Are you okay?

59
00:02:06,997 --> 00:02:08,746
(sighs) I'm fine.

60
00:02:08,771 --> 00:02:10,379
Once I testify, this
whole thing will be over,

61
00:02:10,392 --> 00:02:12,749
I never have to think
about the kidnapping again,

62
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:14,786
and my life can get
finally get back to normal.

63
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,149
Done.

64
00:02:17,211 --> 00:02:19,639
Well, if you need a ride
down to the courthouse,

65
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,653
I'm your man. I have nothing but time.

66
00:02:21,672 --> 00:02:22,676
Nah, I'm actually good.

67
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,817
I'm going to go with Adrianna.

68
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:25,579
She's got to be down
there anyway for her...

69
00:02:25,581 --> 00:02:27,915
wardrobe malfunction.

70
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:29,730
Yeah, tell her to plead insanity.

71
00:02:29,755 --> 00:02:31,135
(wry laugh)

72
00:02:32,714 --> 00:02:34,389
(sighs)

73
00:02:38,119 --> 00:02:40,898
Thank you for letting me go
through your closet, Silver.

74
00:02:41,018 --> 00:02:42,342
I can't believe that they're charging me

75
00:02:42,342 --> 00:02:44,257
with indecent exposure.

76
00:02:44,377 --> 00:02:46,384
I need something to wear
in court that screams

77
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:47,902
"I'm not a sex criminal."

78
00:02:47,904 --> 00:02:50,995
All of my non-slutty clothes are
probably on the left-hand side.

79
00:02:51,014 --> 00:02:52,553
I knew flashing a stadium full of people

80
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,291
at a charity event would impact my career,

81
00:02:54,267 --> 00:02:56,794
but I had no idea it was
going to become my trademark.

82
00:02:56,796 --> 00:02:58,860
I haven't been able to book
a gig since it happened.

83
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,049
And every time I talk to someone,

84
00:03:00,061 --> 00:03:02,498
I feel like they're imagining
me with my shirt off.

85
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,197
I'm sorry, I really would love to talk

86
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,073
but I have to bolt.

87
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:06,725
I'm supposed to pick up
Michaela in, like, five minutes,

88
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,863
and show her around C.U.

89
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,171
Michaela?

90
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:10,547
Oh, your surrogate.

91
00:03:10,554 --> 00:03:12,969
And Shane's sister. Weird, I know.

92
00:03:13,012 --> 00:03:14,464
Teddy and I are splitting the living costs,

93
00:03:14,482 --> 00:03:15,677
but I have to oversee everything else:

94
00:03:15,684 --> 00:03:17,686
her doctor's appointments, her housing,

95
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,056
her diet, her exercise.

96
00:03:19,093 --> 00:03:21,309
It's super overwhelming,
and I can't talk right now.

97
00:03:21,309 --> 00:03:22,984
But help yourself to anything in the closet

98
00:03:23,004 --> 00:03:24,650
and we'll totally catch up later.

99
00:03:25,691 --> 00:03:27,025
(door closes)

100
00:03:30,525 --> 00:03:32,313
Shirazi.

101
00:03:32,315 --> 00:03:34,822
Dude, finals week sucks.

102
00:03:34,997 --> 00:03:37,831
All of our extracurricular
activities are on hold,

103
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,440
so I don't get to watch your
buddy Liam pound anybody.

104
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:41,298
(chuckle)

105
00:03:41,316 --> 00:03:42,874
You going to Finals Frolic tomorrow?

106
00:03:42,905 --> 00:03:44,040
There's going to be plenty of women,

107
00:03:44,038 --> 00:03:45,041
Battle of the Bands.

108
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:45,821
Yeah, maybe.

109
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,229
I just have to get through this exam first.

110
00:03:47,698 --> 00:03:49,125
Oh, please, God.

111
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,095
Don't sweat it, you're gonna do fine.

112
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:52,728
Yeah, I wish I had your confidence.

113
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,555
Calculus is not my best subject.

114
00:03:54,605 --> 00:03:57,221
Navid, you are a member
of the Cronus Society.

115
00:03:57,223 --> 00:03:59,340
Everything is our best subject.

116
00:03:59,342 --> 00:04:01,809
Just don't forget to leave
your phone on, all right?

117
00:04:01,811 --> 00:04:02,787
Why?

118
00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:06,423
In case I have to call with
more party info or something.

119
00:04:06,492 --> 00:04:08,657
- See ya, bud.
- See ya.

120
00:04:08,676 --> 00:04:09,977
So this is C.U.

121
00:04:10,015 --> 00:04:12,148
Teddy said you were a
semester away from graduating,

122
00:04:12,155 --> 00:04:13,954
so I figured we could sign
you up with some classes.

123
00:04:13,982 --> 00:04:15,284
Obviously nothing too crazy,

124
00:04:15,325 --> 00:04:16,497
because I don't think an all-nighter would

125
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:17,248
be good for the baby.

126
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,356
Actually, school's kind
of more my family's thing.

127
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,852
That's why I was so
excited to get this job.

128
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:23,899
I get to move to L.A.,
meet a bunch of cool people.

129
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:26,250
Yeah, meet a bunch of cool
people, that will happen.

130
00:04:26,252 --> 00:04:27,458
Maybe while you're pregnant though,

131
00:04:27,477 --> 00:04:29,742
you'll want to learn something. Right?

132
00:04:31,507 --> 00:04:32,689
Navid.

133
00:04:33,202 --> 00:04:34,760
This is Michaela, remember?

134
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,067
Oh, yeah.

135
00:04:36,124 --> 00:04:37,870
We met at, uh, Dixon's place.

136
00:04:37,901 --> 00:04:39,014
- Yeah.
- How's it going?

137
00:04:39,058 --> 00:04:40,098
It's great.

138
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,375
I'm going to go grab a course book.

139
00:04:42,393 --> 00:04:43,413
Just in case.

140
00:04:43,607 --> 00:04:45,219
I'll be right back.

141
00:04:46,523 --> 00:04:49,205
Hey, look, thanks for not saying anything,

142
00:04:49,264 --> 00:04:51,122
about us hooking up the other night.

143
00:04:51,242 --> 00:04:52,724
Yeah, I figured it's not the impression

144
00:04:52,724 --> 00:04:54,207
you wanted to make during your interview.

145
00:04:54,207 --> 00:04:55,258
(chuckling): No, definitely not.

146
00:04:55,283 --> 00:04:57,242
Plus, if it got back to Teddy and Shane,

147
00:04:57,242 --> 00:04:58,706
my whole family would start freaking out

148
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:00,970
that I wasn't being like
responsible Michaela.

149
00:05:00,989 --> 00:05:01,871
Yeah.

150
00:05:01,908 --> 00:05:03,516
Even though we were totally responsible.

151
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,068
Twice.

152
00:05:05,093 --> 00:05:06,369
It's cool. I get it.

153
00:05:06,576 --> 00:05:09,976
Uh. besides, Silver and
I have a complicated past,

154
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:11,344
and telling her I slept with her surrogate

155
00:05:11,332 --> 00:05:14,091
might make things a
little more complicated.

156
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:16,418
- Found it.
- Oh, thank you.

157
00:05:16,436 --> 00:05:18,102
Oh, there is an amazing
organic smoothie place

158
00:05:18,095 --> 00:05:19,835
right down the street. I
think you're going to love it.

159
00:05:19,897 --> 00:05:20,855
You want to come?

160
00:05:20,857 --> 00:05:21,661
Sounds extra super,

161
00:05:21,642 --> 00:05:23,156
but I've got to make
it to my calculus final.

162
00:05:23,194 --> 00:05:24,574
You two ladies have a great day.

163
00:05:24,694 --> 00:05:26,040
- Yeah, good luck.
- Bye.

164
00:05:26,103 --> 00:05:27,498
See ya.

165
00:05:36,301 --> 00:05:39,048
(phone buzzes)

166
00:05:56,592 --> 00:05:58,509
(sighs)

167
00:05:59,602 --> 00:06:02,086
Okay, Naomi, I got your emergency text.

168
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,757
It better be bigger than a shoe sale,

169
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:04,977
because I have a lot going on right now.

170
00:06:04,995 --> 00:06:07,936
Annie, this is Mark Holland. (giggles)

171
00:06:08,111 --> 00:06:09,469
He owns a food truck.

172
00:06:09,512 --> 00:06:12,490
I told him how we need his
help planning a massive party.

173
00:06:12,515 --> 00:06:13,285
We do?

174
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,655
I was a little surprised, too.

175
00:06:14,661 --> 00:06:16,251
I appreciate you considering me,

176
00:06:16,263 --> 00:06:18,247
it's just, I own a taco truck.

177
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,098
I'm still not clear who gave you my number.

178
00:06:20,218 --> 00:06:22,382
Annie and I have a half-brother

179
00:06:22,413 --> 00:06:24,217
who was given up for
adoption before we were born.

180
00:06:24,228 --> 00:06:26,768
Her father seduced my mother
at a high school dance,

181
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:28,745
and the rest is sordid family history.

182
00:06:28,758 --> 00:06:30,991
Which you just shared
with a total stranger.

183
00:06:30,993 --> 00:06:33,161
And we need your help
planning a celebration

184
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,352
to welcome him back into our lives.

185
00:06:35,377 --> 00:06:36,991
Uh, no, we don't.

186
00:06:37,254 --> 00:06:38,292
It's time.

187
00:06:38,324 --> 00:06:39,850
Don't you remember what
happened the last time

188
00:06:39,863 --> 00:06:41,702
a half-brother came into our lives?

189
00:06:41,771 --> 00:06:43,069
He stole money from your mother

190
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,461
and almost ruined our friendship.

191
00:06:44,486 --> 00:06:46,369
That was completely
different; he was an impostor.

192
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,257
You know what?

193
00:06:47,276 --> 00:06:49,059
Why don't you guys talk privately,

194
00:06:49,062 --> 00:06:50,177
figure out what you want,

195
00:06:50,179 --> 00:06:52,730
and if it ends up being a taco truck,

196
00:06:52,732 --> 00:06:53,948
give me a call.

197
00:06:54,234 --> 00:06:56,742
I don't know what got this into your head,

198
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,544
but it is a horrible idea.

199
00:06:58,571 --> 00:07:00,252
What makes you think you
can even find this person

200
00:07:00,264 --> 00:07:01,065
in the first place?

201
00:07:01,074 --> 00:07:02,854
Because I already did. He's right here?

202
00:07:02,861 --> 00:07:04,637
Oh, hi.

203
00:07:05,513 --> 00:07:07,071
Why are you both looking at me?

204
00:07:07,463 --> 00:07:09,875
He's our half-brother?

205
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,534
Surprise!

206
00:07:15,187 --> 00:07:17,805
Welcome to our family.

207
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,594
(theme music playing)

209
00:07:36,278 --> 00:07:37,848
I can't believe you would go looking

210
00:07:37,861 --> 00:07:40,038
for our half-brother without
talking to me first, Naomi.

211
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:42,153
How could you do something like this?

212
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:43,304
I hired a P.I.

213
00:07:43,316 --> 00:07:44,837
You hired someone to find me?

214
00:07:44,957 --> 00:07:46,602
I am so sorry.

215
00:07:46,627 --> 00:07:48,103
My divorce from Max left a hole in my life,

216
00:07:48,128 --> 00:07:49,260
one that I would usually fill by

217
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,943
jumping in bed with the next man I met.

218
00:07:51,063 --> 00:07:52,757
But I am trying to evolve.

219
00:07:52,782 --> 00:07:56,543
So, I need a deeply personal,
yet non-sexual relationship...

220
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,414
like you have with Dixon...
hence, I found my brother.

221
00:08:00,925 --> 00:08:03,993
So, is there a job or not?

222
00:08:04,018 --> 00:08:06,596
No, I made that up to bring you here.

223
00:08:07,315 --> 00:08:09,668
All right then, take it easy.

224
00:08:09,674 --> 00:08:10,337
You're leaving?

225
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:13,108
You don't want to know about...
me... about your family?

226
00:08:13,228 --> 00:08:14,454
I already know about my family:

227
00:08:14,473 --> 00:08:16,168
they're the people who raised me.

228
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:18,683
The non-sexual hole you're looking to fill

229
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:19,759
really isn't my problem.

230
00:08:19,778 --> 00:08:21,299
Now, if you'd excuse me,

231
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,129
I have a business to run.

232
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,000
I can't believe he just walked out.

233
00:08:28,002 --> 00:08:29,638
Like this?

234
00:08:30,614 --> 00:08:32,573
He's your brother, too, Annie.

235
00:08:32,629 --> 00:08:35,532
And his temper clearly comes
from your side of the family.

236
00:08:36,076 --> 00:08:37,797
(sighs)

237
00:08:40,763 --> 00:08:43,933
You went shopping, you
wonderful woman, you.

238
00:08:46,732 --> 00:08:48,384
What the heck is "spelt"?

239
00:08:48,415 --> 00:08:49,942
A whole grain.

240
00:08:49,936 --> 00:08:50,930
And, for the record,

241
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,444
all of this food is for Michaela only.

242
00:08:53,807 --> 00:08:54,983
All of it?

243
00:08:55,103 --> 00:08:56,616
Which reminds me,

244
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:59,351
here's Michaela's first month's rent check

245
00:08:59,363 --> 00:09:00,233
from me and Teddy.

246
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,917
Look, I... I hope giving
your surrogate a room

247
00:09:03,037 --> 00:09:04,499
kind of makes up for the time

248
00:09:04,499 --> 00:09:07,065
I implied that you weren't
ready to be a mother.

249
00:09:07,185 --> 00:09:07,847
(sighs)

250
00:09:08,022 --> 00:09:10,407
You're really helping us out
giving us a good deal on rent,

251
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,978
but, feel free to keep apologizing.

252
00:09:12,984 --> 00:09:15,143
Dixon, your place is amazing.

253
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,050
Thanks.

254
00:09:16,075 --> 00:09:18,058
God, look at that ocean.

255
00:09:18,178 --> 00:09:19,879
Hey, do you think you
could teach me how to surf?

256
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:22,025
Oh, that's probably not going to happen.

257
00:09:22,025 --> 00:09:24,985
I mean, the water's, like,
really polluted and, uh...

258
00:09:24,985 --> 00:09:26,962
those guys out there take
really big falls, so...

259
00:09:27,082 --> 00:09:29,270
It's pretty safe, actually.

260
00:09:29,864 --> 00:09:32,562
But, I wouldn't even
have the time to show you.

261
00:09:32,593 --> 00:09:33,319
It's crazy.

262
00:09:33,313 --> 00:09:34,870
Actually, I've got to make my way down

263
00:09:34,877 --> 00:09:36,291
to the Offshore right now.

264
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,224
Annie says she has a big surprise for me.

265
00:09:38,236 --> 00:09:41,058
Hopefully, it's a trust
fund that I don't know about.

266
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:43,326
See you guys later.

267
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:48,352
I actually have a surprise for you, too.

268
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:50,187
Nothing exciting, but...

269
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,945
some books on pregnancy!

270
00:09:51,932 --> 00:09:52,657
Oh...

271
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,435
What to eat, what not
to eat, the whole thing.

272
00:09:55,479 --> 00:09:57,274
And I signed us up for yoga tomorrow.

273
00:09:57,394 --> 00:09:58,175
Tomorrow?

274
00:09:58,238 --> 00:10:00,665
Yeah. Why, do you have something going on?

275
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:04,432
Oh, no, I mean, I just thought since we

276
00:10:04,426 --> 00:10:06,954
spent the last few days
shopping for course materials

277
00:10:06,941 --> 00:10:08,293
and prenatal vitamins,

278
00:10:08,293 --> 00:10:10,521
maybe I could have tomorrow off?

279
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,585
I don't really know what you mean by off.

280
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,318
I mean, you're having my baby.

281
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:15,664
It's not like a nine-to-five job

282
00:10:15,664 --> 00:10:17,059
you can just punch a clock.

283
00:10:17,309 --> 00:10:19,717
Right. So, yoga tomorrow then?

284
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,482
Yes, that would be awesome.

285
00:10:21,545 --> 00:10:22,896
I think you're going to love it.

286
00:10:23,084 --> 00:10:24,116
Yeah.

287
00:10:24,461 --> 00:10:26,357
Fun, fun, fun.

288
00:10:27,826 --> 00:10:29,160
Oh. Psst!

289
00:10:29,366 --> 00:10:30,980
Campbell, hey. Dude.

290
00:10:30,999 --> 00:10:32,300
Hey, what's up?

291
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:34,082
Hey, uh, are you out of your mind?

292
00:10:34,084 --> 00:10:35,867
Why did you text me
those answers yesterday?

293
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:37,681
I was doing fine on that test.

294
00:10:37,706 --> 00:10:40,209
Navid, it's no big deal, all right?

295
00:10:40,177 --> 00:10:41,454
It's just a little something we do for

296
00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:43,399
for our Cronus Society
members to keep our grades up.

297
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:45,220
Besides, you didn't have to use the answers

298
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,084
if you didn't want to.

299
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,104
Yeah, uh... (quietly): I couldn't help it.

300
00:10:48,104 --> 00:10:50,038
Okay, once I saw them
scrolling across my phone,

301
00:10:50,158 --> 00:10:51,689
I couldn't get them out of my head.

302
00:10:51,927 --> 00:10:53,716
Great, so you did a little better

303
00:10:53,716 --> 00:10:55,456
than you would have otherwise.

304
00:10:55,576 --> 00:10:57,121
Nobody got hurt.

305
00:10:57,346 --> 00:10:58,779
Now you can return the favor.

306
00:10:58,816 --> 00:11:00,268
- Favor?
- Yeah.

307
00:11:00,275 --> 00:11:01,420
What... what do you mean?

308
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,127
Our physics final is coming up.

309
00:11:03,152 --> 00:11:05,073
You've aced every test this semester.

310
00:11:05,136 --> 00:11:06,637
So, once you figure out the answers

311
00:11:06,668 --> 00:11:08,458
just text them to the rest of the guys.

312
00:11:08,489 --> 00:11:09,622
Yeah, uh...

313
00:11:09,684 --> 00:11:10,936
I... I can't do that.

314
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,907
Accepting help for something
I didn't ask for was one thing,

315
00:11:12,913 --> 00:11:13,858
but people get kicked out of school

316
00:11:13,864 --> 00:11:15,153
for this kind of stuff.

317
00:11:15,328 --> 00:11:17,718
Hmm. Fine.

318
00:11:17,838 --> 00:11:19,714
Then you're out of Cronus.

319
00:11:19,834 --> 00:11:21,404
Are... are you serious?

320
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,361
Yeah.

321
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:24,570
And since you know about
our little arrangement,

322
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,810
we're going to have to kill you.

323
00:11:27,992 --> 00:11:29,907
Dude... I'm kidding.

324
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:32,015
All right, loosen up.
Yeah, of course you are.

325
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,091
It's not that big of a deal.

326
00:11:33,097 --> 00:11:35,794
We'll just get somebody else to do it.

327
00:11:36,194 --> 00:11:37,539
Really?

328
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:38,665
- Yeah.
- All right.

329
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:41,325
It takes a lot of guts to
stand up for your convictions

330
00:11:41,331 --> 00:11:42,370
instead of help out your friends.

331
00:11:42,382 --> 00:11:43,646
I admire that.

332
00:11:43,766 --> 00:11:44,828
I'll see you at the Frolic, right?

333
00:11:44,853 --> 00:11:46,061
Yeah, absolutely.

334
00:11:46,092 --> 00:11:48,238
- All right, see ya, bud.
- Yeah, see ya.

335
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:51,860
(sighs)

336
00:11:56,665 --> 00:11:57,628
I can't believe my sister

337
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,780
took over a college Battle of
the Bands to find me clients.

338
00:11:59,774 --> 00:12:02,821
This officially makes me the
worst music producer in history.

339
00:12:02,846 --> 00:12:04,323
No, it doesn't.

340
00:12:04,352 --> 00:12:06,769
New artists are discovered
this way all the time.

341
00:12:06,771 --> 00:12:08,504
They found Justin Bieber on the Internet.

342
00:12:08,506 --> 00:12:10,079
Do you know how many dancing babies

343
00:12:10,085 --> 00:12:11,862
and weirdly talented
cats you got to go through

344
00:12:11,874 --> 00:12:12,844
just to find something like that?

345
00:12:12,907 --> 00:12:14,660
This is going to be easy.

346
00:12:14,662 --> 00:12:16,241
As my talent coordinator,

347
00:12:16,229 --> 00:12:17,837
you get V.I.P. access to all the bands.

348
00:12:17,831 --> 00:12:19,997
With any luck, you'll find
someone you'll want to sign,

349
00:12:20,027 --> 00:12:21,949
your music label will be back in business,

350
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,344
and you can finally stop stressing.

351
00:12:23,788 --> 00:12:25,371
Start listening to demos.

352
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:28,355
Annie, hi. Have you seen Liam?

353
00:12:28,424 --> 00:12:30,044
I need to talk to him
about renting the Offshore

354
00:12:30,044 --> 00:12:31,496
to start a restaurant.

355
00:12:35,362 --> 00:12:37,352
This has something to
do with Mark, doesn't it?

356
00:12:37,351 --> 00:12:39,178
Our brother who sells
food out of a truck? No.

357
00:12:39,178 --> 00:12:39,935
Naomi.

358
00:12:39,973 --> 00:12:42,425
Okay, look, I realize that
my little stunt yesterday

359
00:12:42,424 --> 00:12:44,196
backfired, so I'm turning to plan B.

360
00:12:44,202 --> 00:12:46,154
If Mark doesn't have time
for me in his private life,

361
00:12:46,197 --> 00:12:47,605
I will buy a restaurant and be a part

362
00:12:47,618 --> 00:12:48,593
of his professional one.

363
00:12:48,595 --> 00:12:51,596
Well, in case you've forgotten,
I already have a brother.

364
00:12:51,609 --> 00:12:54,099
And Dixon's already under
a huge amount of pressure

365
00:12:54,118 --> 00:12:55,868
after losing Ade from
his record label, okay?

366
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,441
Last time a half-brother showed
up, he completely flipped out.

367
00:12:58,456 --> 00:13:00,568
He doesn't need this right
now, and neither do I.

368
00:13:00,562 --> 00:13:02,151
Uh-huh, what about Mark?

369
00:13:02,776 --> 00:13:04,640
You saw how cute and middle-class he was.

370
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,723
He needs me in his life.

371
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,950
Okay, you can't just
take over people's lives

372
00:13:07,963 --> 00:13:10,109
and fix them, Naomi. It doesn't work.

373
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:12,492
Hey, Annie, thanks for hooking this up.

374
00:13:12,554 --> 00:13:14,936
Some of these bands are
actually pretty decent.

375
00:13:14,957 --> 00:13:17,528
If you forcing me to do this contest

376
00:13:17,553 --> 00:13:18,835
brings me back into this business,

377
00:13:18,842 --> 00:13:22,545
I officially owe all of my
success to my beautiful sister.

378
00:13:22,545 --> 00:13:23,429
(giggling)

379
00:13:23,431 --> 00:13:24,763
Oh.

380
00:13:24,765 --> 00:13:26,900
(laughs quietly)

381
00:13:26,963 --> 00:13:28,451
Hi, kettle, I'm pot.

382
00:13:28,489 --> 00:13:29,883
Nice to meet you.

383
00:13:30,003 --> 00:13:31,370
(scoffs)

384
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,413
Okay, how does this sound?

385
00:13:35,432 --> 00:13:37,959
Your Honor, I know that
I have made some mistakes,

386
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,886
and every since the incident,

387
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,907
my career has a taken a huge nosedive,

388
00:13:42,295 --> 00:13:43,915
but throwing the book at me would be cruel

389
00:13:43,921 --> 00:13:45,492
and unusual punishment.

390
00:13:46,486 --> 00:13:49,027
You flashed a group of
people, you didn't rob a bank.

391
00:13:49,065 --> 00:13:50,429
They'll probably just give you a warning.

392
00:13:50,491 --> 00:13:51,589
That'd be great.

393
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:53,926
That way I could put
this huge mess behind me.

394
00:13:53,928 --> 00:13:55,815
I can't wait to put this behind me either.

395
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,249
Sooner they put Ashley away,

396
00:13:58,369 --> 00:13:59,769
the sooner I can start pretending

397
00:13:59,801 --> 00:14:01,389
this whole kidnapping thing never happened.

398
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:02,968
Liam Court.

399
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:04,856
Yeah. That's me.

400
00:14:05,057 --> 00:14:06,539
Wish me luck.

401
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,940
ASHLEY: Liam.

402
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,486
Liam, thank God you're here.

403
00:14:09,518 --> 00:14:11,132
Everyone is so confused.

404
00:14:11,195 --> 00:14:13,647
They don't understand I
was trying to protect you.

405
00:14:13,703 --> 00:14:15,368
You have to tell them the truth.

406
00:14:15,736 --> 00:14:17,914
Liam! Liam!

407
00:14:19,471 --> 00:14:21,398
Are you okay?

408
00:14:21,636 --> 00:14:23,655
Yeah, just got to get some water.

409
00:14:28,861 --> 00:14:31,330
(breathing heavily)

410
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:36,909
Are you sure you're okay?

411
00:14:36,947 --> 00:14:38,273
(grunts)

412
00:14:39,806 --> 00:14:41,006
(choking)

413
00:14:41,008 --> 00:14:43,409
Hey, get off of her.

414
00:14:44,348 --> 00:14:46,951
Hey, why are you grabbing
me, she's the one who...

415
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:49,815
- Come on.
- Ade...

416
00:14:56,287 --> 00:14:57,904
How's Ade?

417
00:14:57,906 --> 00:15:00,407
Shaken but fine.

418
00:15:00,409 --> 00:15:01,541
She's worried about you.

419
00:15:01,543 --> 00:15:03,299
The court said they wouldn't release me

420
00:15:03,261 --> 00:15:05,495
until I saw a medical professional.

421
00:15:05,497 --> 00:15:06,890
Maybe they're right.

422
00:15:06,832 --> 00:15:08,148
Maybe I do need help.

423
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:10,417
Adrianna told me what's going on with you.

424
00:15:10,537 --> 00:15:13,753
The kidnapping, your friend's shooting.

425
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:16,275
Liam, have you been
having trouble sleeping?

426
00:15:16,262 --> 00:15:17,957
Mood swings, anxiety?

427
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:19,196
No more than anyone else

428
00:15:19,215 --> 00:15:21,067
who almost got shipped to Mexico in a box.

429
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:22,669
Liam, I think you are suffering

430
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,596
from post-traumatic stress disorder.

431
00:15:24,846 --> 00:15:27,693
PTSD? It's not like I went to war.

432
00:15:27,681 --> 00:15:30,946
Combat isn't the only cause,
but treatment's pretty standard.

433
00:15:30,984 --> 00:15:33,192
(sighs) Cognitive behavior therapy.

434
00:15:33,316 --> 00:15:35,808
You need to confront the things
that remind you of your trauma

435
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:38,152
and deal with what happened
instead of hiding from it.

436
00:15:38,154 --> 00:15:40,700
So, you're saying I need to
do more of what I did today,

437
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:41,872
'Cause that worked out great.

438
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,015
Confronting your past

439
00:15:43,053 --> 00:15:44,625
is the only way to start feeling better.

440
00:15:44,627 --> 00:15:47,945
Don't take this the wrong
way, but that sounds crazy.

441
00:15:49,781 --> 00:15:51,716
(sighs)

442
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:53,457
Are we done here?

443
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:22,595
Hello. Welcome to C.U.'s First Annual

444
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:24,103
Food Truck Competition.

445
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:25,583
Wait, you work here?

446
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:28,740
If by work here you mean,
created the entire contest,

447
00:16:28,752 --> 00:16:29,953
then yes.

448
00:16:30,266 --> 00:16:32,012
What are you doing?

449
00:16:32,675 --> 00:16:34,390
I already wasted half my day yesterday

450
00:16:34,408 --> 00:16:35,678
with your fake catering job.

451
00:16:35,697 --> 00:16:38,012
I think I'll pass on
the pretend food contest.

452
00:16:38,018 --> 00:16:40,953
Oh, so I guess it doesn't matter
that Wolfgang Puck is judging?

453
00:16:41,497 --> 00:16:42,724
The Wolfgang Puck?

454
00:16:42,761 --> 00:16:44,013
Such a charming man.

455
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:46,810
I mean, he single-handedly changed
the face of American cuisine.

456
00:16:46,835 --> 00:16:48,130
The guy's amazing.

457
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:50,032
He started with nothing
and created an empire.

458
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,778
You could do the same thing
if you win the contest.

459
00:16:52,109 --> 00:16:53,968
First prize is a write-up from Wolfgang,

460
00:16:53,964 --> 00:16:55,563
plus a silent partner will help you

461
00:16:55,594 --> 00:16:59,067
open up your own restaurant at
this amazing waterfront location.

462
00:16:59,111 --> 00:17:00,900
But if you prefer selling tacos

463
00:17:00,956 --> 00:17:04,238
to tourists at the tar pits,
then by all means, fly free.

464
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,881
Okay, fine, I'll do the contest.

465
00:17:07,169 --> 00:17:08,301
But just so we're clear,

466
00:17:08,314 --> 00:17:09,794
I'm doing this to help my business.

467
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:10,961
Don't think it means we're taking

468
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,550
family vacations together.

469
00:17:20,371 --> 00:17:21,589
Adrianna.

470
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,269
Oh, hey. Hi.

471
00:17:26,389 --> 00:17:29,918
Look, I just wanted to
apologize again for yesterday.

472
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:31,482
It's fine.

473
00:17:31,689 --> 00:17:34,812
- You didn't realize it was me.
- Yeah.

474
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,407
So, did you talk to that therapist?

475
00:17:36,457 --> 00:17:38,472
Yeah. But she's clueless.

476
00:17:38,592 --> 00:17:40,943
She keeps trying to talk me into
some kind of stupid treatment.

477
00:17:40,956 --> 00:17:42,232
But, Liam, if you don't get help,

478
00:17:42,232 --> 00:17:44,334
how do you know this isn't
going to happen again?

479
00:17:45,241 --> 00:17:46,796
Okay, let's-let's make a deal.

480
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,269
Once you fix your own life,

481
00:17:48,256 --> 00:17:50,446
then you can tell me how to run mine.

482
00:18:00,525 --> 00:18:02,413
Didn't I meet you at a bar somewhere?

483
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,335
I didn't know you were going to be here.

484
00:18:04,392 --> 00:18:05,124
Where's Silver?

485
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:05,933
Not here.

486
00:18:05,935 --> 00:18:08,134
I needed a break, so I got away.

487
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:11,036
And since there's not a baby
supply store within sight,

488
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:12,500
- I think we're safe.
- Ah.

489
00:18:12,563 --> 00:18:13,707
You feel like hanging out?

490
00:18:13,732 --> 00:18:15,359
Sure, yeah.

491
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,087
Who's to say we didn't, uh,
just bump into each other?

492
00:18:18,156 --> 00:18:21,034
And decided to catch a little music.

493
00:18:21,078 --> 00:18:22,433
Awesome.

494
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:23,837
So, I'm going to get some food

495
00:18:23,856 --> 00:18:25,564
that doesn't contain any healthy fiber.

496
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,084
I'll see you in five.

497
00:18:27,378 --> 00:18:28,406
Okay.

498
00:18:33,566 --> 00:18:36,714
So... looks like you totally hooked up

499
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,778
with that girl from the bar the
other night and didn't tell us.

500
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:40,611
Ah, she's... she's a nice girl.

501
00:18:40,731 --> 00:18:42,238
- I didn't want to make a big deal.
- Mm-hmm.

502
00:18:42,257 --> 00:18:45,197
And if her boss found out it
could cause a lot of problems.

503
00:18:45,197 --> 00:18:46,874
Hey, so can you do me a favor,

504
00:18:46,899 --> 00:18:48,507
and just keep this between us?

505
00:18:49,051 --> 00:18:52,680
You want me to lie to the
guys about what I just saw?

506
00:18:52,682 --> 00:18:56,052
I'm starting to see some cracks
in that moral code of yours.

507
00:18:56,877 --> 00:18:58,479
But, hey, your secret's safe with me.

508
00:18:58,497 --> 00:19:00,404
I mean, that's what
Cronus is all about, right?

509
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:02,664
Friends helping each other out.

510
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:04,742
All right, I got to go man, I'll see ya.

511
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:05,999
See ya.

512
00:19:09,981 --> 00:19:13,487
Man, this is probably the best taco

513
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,376
I've ever had in my life.

514
00:19:14,432 --> 00:19:15,865
And I'm not just saying that because

515
00:19:15,871 --> 00:19:17,760
- I've been working since 8:00.
- Thanks.

516
00:19:17,742 --> 00:19:20,050
This event's actually turning
into huge business for me.

517
00:19:20,063 --> 00:19:22,140
Yeah, well, hopefully for me, too.

518
00:19:22,178 --> 00:19:24,436
Running this contest was my sister's idea,

519
00:19:24,556 --> 00:19:26,332
and it's actually turning
out to be a pretty good one.

520
00:19:26,344 --> 00:19:26,939
You know what?

521
00:19:26,949 --> 00:19:28,885
I kind of got dragged
into this the same way.

522
00:19:29,005 --> 00:19:30,180
But I'm having a blast.

523
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,969
- I... I... I'm Mark.
- Dixon.

524
00:19:32,407 --> 00:19:33,670
Good to meet you, man.

525
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,823
Uh, what are you doing here?

526
00:19:36,192 --> 00:19:37,491
I'm getting a taco.

527
00:19:37,951 --> 00:19:40,711
Mark, this is my sister, Annie.

528
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:42,430
Wait, she's your sister?

529
00:19:42,461 --> 00:19:44,926
And Dixon is my one and only brother.

530
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:45,903
If you know what I mean?

531
00:19:45,903 --> 00:19:46,391
I don't.

532
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,017
Look, I'm just here to win
Naomi's food truck contest.

533
00:19:49,137 --> 00:19:51,495
Wait, this whole contest was Naomi's idea?

534
00:19:51,727 --> 00:19:53,954
Yeah, I didn't realize throwing contests

535
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:55,708
for your relatives was a family tradition.

536
00:19:55,706 --> 00:19:57,495
So, you guys know each other

537
00:19:57,564 --> 00:19:58,961
and you know Naomi?

538
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,636
We shouldn't hold the line up.

539
00:20:00,655 --> 00:20:02,250
Uh, we would love to stick around and chat

540
00:20:02,263 --> 00:20:03,614
but Dixon and I have a lot to do right now

541
00:20:03,633 --> 00:20:04,515
and I'm sure you do, too.

542
00:20:04,547 --> 00:20:06,292
It was nice meeting you. Bye.

Aren't you Adrianna Tate-Duncan?

551
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:31,055
Yeah.

552
00:20:31,062 --> 00:20:33,358
My band is supposed to be
on stage in five minutes,

553
00:20:33,395 --> 00:20:34,772
and we lost our lead singer.

554
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:37,162
Now I know this is going to sound crazy,

555
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:40,415
but is there any chance you'd
consider performing with us?

556
00:20:41,629 --> 00:20:42,711
You want me to sing?

557
00:20:42,711 --> 00:20:45,470
Yeah, we're huge fans,
lyrics are super easy,

558
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,390
and you would totally be saving our ass.

559
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,331
You know what, sure, why not?

560
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,416
Awesome. The guys are gonna flip.

561
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,552
Come on. (laughs)

562
00:20:57,532 --> 00:20:59,809
Wolfgang, thanks again for coming.

563
00:20:59,828 --> 00:21:01,398
You have turned our little contest

564
00:21:01,404 --> 00:21:03,188
into an enormous success.

565
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,897
I love helping young chefs get
the recognition they deserve.

566
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:08,282
How are you finding the food?

567
00:21:08,284 --> 00:21:10,308
Anyone in particular
standing out in your mind?

568
00:21:10,345 --> 00:21:11,359
As a matter of fact,

569
00:21:11,384 --> 00:21:14,005
the taco truck over there is fantastic.

570
00:21:14,037 --> 00:21:15,782
You know, I'm completely impartial,

571
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,514
but they're my favorite, too. (laughs)

572
00:21:17,634 --> 00:21:21,163
Right now, he's in first place
with this crepe truck over here.

573
00:21:21,283 --> 00:21:22,752
Oh, tied?

574
00:21:22,777 --> 00:21:25,186
Yeah, maybe I have to
go for another tasting.

575
00:21:25,524 --> 00:21:26,967
That's an excellent idea. (laughs)

576
00:21:27,006 --> 00:21:29,221
But first, do you want
to go cleanse your palate

577
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,184
over at the beer garden?

578
00:21:30,203 --> 00:21:31,567
You can tell them Naomi sent you.

579
00:21:31,592 --> 00:21:32,673
Thanks.

580
00:21:39,349 --> 00:21:41,101
Mmm. Peppers.

581
00:21:41,107 --> 00:21:43,866
Careful, these jalapeños
are painfully spicy.

582
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,618
Everyone is loving your tacos,

583
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:47,951
but... the contest isn't over yet.

584
00:21:47,977 --> 00:21:49,491
So, if you have any tricks up your sleeve,

585
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:51,111
you might want to whip them out now.

586
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,469
What kind of tricks?

587
00:21:52,507 --> 00:21:55,866
Oh, I don't know, a
secret sauce or something.

588
00:21:55,885 --> 00:21:57,615
This is pretty much what I do.

589
00:21:58,446 --> 00:22:00,692
Well, you don't want
anything getting in the way

590
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,069
of opening up your restaurant.

591
00:22:02,081 --> 00:22:03,514
Besides, if you're anything like me,

592
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:05,503
you want to crush the competition.

593
00:22:05,547 --> 00:22:07,605
Well, then, I guess I'm
not anything like you.

594
00:22:07,987 --> 00:22:09,159
I got to get back to work.

595
00:22:33,996 --> 00:22:35,454
Hey, Ade.

596
00:22:35,574 --> 00:22:37,318
Look, I really need your help.

597
00:22:37,438 --> 00:22:39,563
Um, I'm kind of trying to learn this song.

598
00:22:39,582 --> 00:22:41,522
Can it wait? This is, like,
an emergency, all right?

599
00:22:41,522 --> 00:22:42,779
Michaela, she bailed on yoga class.

600
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:44,449
Now I can't find her anywhere.

601
00:22:44,449 --> 00:22:45,832
Oh, my God, seriously?

602
00:22:45,895 --> 00:22:47,746
- What? This is important.
- Yeah, like,

603
00:22:47,777 --> 00:22:48,841
way more important than anything

604
00:22:48,859 --> 00:22:50,380
going on in my life right now.

605
00:22:50,449 --> 00:22:51,907
Like the fact that I'm
about to get on stage

606
00:22:51,932 --> 00:22:53,777
with a band that I just
met five minutes ago.

607
00:22:53,897 --> 00:22:56,105
Or how about yesterday,
when I was in court with Liam

608
00:22:56,092 --> 00:22:57,450
and he tried to strangle me?

609
00:22:57,494 --> 00:22:58,439
What?

610
00:22:58,501 --> 00:23:00,110
Liam tried to strangle you?

611
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:01,493
(scoffs) You know what?

612
00:23:01,499 --> 00:23:02,694
Don't even worry about it.

613
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:04,001
It doesn't affect your life,

614
00:23:03,995 --> 00:23:05,732
so it's not important, right?

615
00:23:05,734 --> 00:23:07,867
Now, if you'll excuse me,

616
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:10,253
I have to go try and save my career.

617
00:23:11,822 --> 00:23:14,107
♪

618
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:19,913
Well, that band was pretty interesting.

619
00:23:19,915 --> 00:23:21,550
Yeah. Uh, not as interesting

620
00:23:21,594 --> 00:23:23,633
as what just happened at the food truck.

621
00:23:23,753 --> 00:23:25,867
Dixon, nothing was going on.

622
00:23:25,921 --> 00:23:27,963
I just needed to get you back here.

623
00:23:27,994 --> 00:23:29,388
I mean, I didn't put on this whole contest

624
00:23:29,358 --> 00:23:32,397
so you could stand around
chatting with some taco guy.

625
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,430
Well, he seemed like he was

626
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:34,775
more than just some taco guy.

627
00:23:34,837 --> 00:23:35,807
He wasn't.

628
00:23:35,927 --> 00:23:36,802
Annie, come on.

629
00:23:36,865 --> 00:23:38,098
We're grown, okay?

630
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,355
You can tell me the truth.

631
00:23:39,355 --> 00:23:41,138
What, did you sleep with him or something?

632
00:23:41,132 --> 00:23:42,684
Ew, Dixon. No.

633
00:23:42,709 --> 00:23:44,148
Okay, fine. If you won't tell me,

634
00:23:44,154 --> 00:23:45,155
then I know Naomi will.

635
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:45,806
Okay.

636
00:23:45,856 --> 00:23:47,324
Okay, look.

637
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:50,944
He is not just the taco guy.

638
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,646
He's our half-brother.

639
00:23:53,648 --> 00:23:54,484
He's our what?

640
00:23:54,521 --> 00:23:55,892
Naomi tracked him down.

641
00:23:55,923 --> 00:23:58,713
She insists that she
needs family in her life,

642
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,965
but I told her I didn't want

643
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:01,649
- any part of it.
- And you weren't gonna tell me?

644
00:24:01,769 --> 00:24:03,187
I was trying to protect you.

645
00:24:03,412 --> 00:24:05,026
The last time I saw you this stressed out,

646
00:24:05,051 --> 00:24:07,805
you ended up in rehab, okay? So...

647
00:24:07,861 --> 00:24:09,781
I don't care what Naomi needs in her life,

648
00:24:09,806 --> 00:24:11,965
because I need you in mine.

649
00:24:11,967 --> 00:24:14,050
You're my brother, not him.

650
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:16,553
I admit things aren't
great for me right now,

651
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:19,373
but there's nothing that's
gonna put me back on drugs.

652
00:24:19,367 --> 00:24:20,975
How can you be so sure of that?

653
00:24:21,095 --> 00:24:22,733
Because I have a 12-step program.

654
00:24:22,946 --> 00:24:24,477
Because I have you.

655
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:27,024
A crazy-ass sister who's
always gonna be there for me.

656
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:29,596
So, I totally understand why Naomi would

657
00:24:29,608 --> 00:24:31,260
need something like that in her life.

658
00:24:31,653 --> 00:24:33,587
I just worry about you, you know?

659
00:24:33,855 --> 00:24:35,427
I know, I know.

660
00:24:35,857 --> 00:24:38,305
But, uh, like it or not,

661
00:24:38,425 --> 00:24:40,363
I'm not your only brother anymore.

662
00:24:43,331 --> 00:24:44,414
(applause)

663
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:46,049
(shrieks): We won!

664
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,607
You won. All you.

665
00:24:47,826 --> 00:24:49,459
Congratulations, Mark.

666
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:52,613
Your tacos were some of
the best I have ever tasted.

667
00:24:52,631 --> 00:24:54,052
You have no idea what that means to me.

668
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:55,342
Honestly, when I saw the crepe truck,

669
00:24:55,346 --> 00:24:56,542
I didn't think I could win.

670
00:24:56,544 --> 00:24:57,580
That guy does some great work.

671
00:24:57,561 --> 00:24:58,650
I thought so, too.

672
00:24:58,606 --> 00:25:00,414
But after my second tasting,

673
00:25:00,534 --> 00:25:03,236
then he put something crazy in his batter.

674
00:25:03,255 --> 00:25:05,551
It tasted like jalapenos.

675
00:25:06,521 --> 00:25:07,772
I'm sorry, did you say "jalapenos"?

676
00:25:07,778 --> 00:25:08,822
Mark, you might want to

677
00:25:08,824 --> 00:25:10,262
pose for the cameras here.

678
00:25:10,324 --> 00:25:11,075
Okay.

679
00:25:13,361 --> 00:25:15,893
What? What?

680
00:25:18,532 --> 00:25:21,251
(speaking German)

681
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:23,076
Uh, Mark? (laughs)

682
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:25,159
NAOMI: Where are you going?

683
00:25:25,235 --> 00:25:26,849
You can't just walk
away from Wolfgang Puck.

684
00:25:26,911 --> 00:25:28,563
You sabotaged another chef's food

685
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:29,858
so I'd win some contest?

686
00:25:29,864 --> 00:25:30,859
What kind of person does that?

687
00:25:30,853 --> 00:25:32,223
I needed you to win.

688
00:25:32,241 --> 00:25:33,268
I wasn't going to open a restaurant

689
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:35,226
with Mr. Flirty Crepe Maker.

690
00:25:36,271 --> 00:25:39,330
The silent partner with the
amazing waterfront space is you?

691

Liam.

717
00:26:49,254 --> 00:26:50,867
Ade told me what happened yesterday.

718
00:26:50,904 --> 00:26:52,462
I really don't want to talk about it.

719
00:26:52,975 --> 00:26:54,476
I'm just here to listen to some music

720
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:56,685
and grab a beer while Navid's buying.

722
00:27:00,965 --> 00:27:02,085
Michaela!

723
00:27:02,205 --> 00:27:04,769
I've been calling you
and looking for you...

724
00:27:04,994 --> 00:27:06,195
Are you drinking beer?

725
00:27:06,252 --> 00:27:07,691
No, the... the beer's mine.

726
00:27:07,741 --> 00:27:08,955
Uh, don't worry about it,

727
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,363
I just gave her a little taste.

728
00:27:10,382 --> 00:27:12,885
So, what, y... you bail on yoga

729
00:27:13,005 --> 00:27:13,905
so you can come and party?

730
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,832
I just needed a break. All right?

731
00:27:15,952 --> 00:27:17,120
I mean, I thought about telling you,

732
00:27:17,158 --> 00:27:18,441
but I didn't want you wigging out.

733
00:27:18,459 --> 00:27:19,605
I'm not pregnant yet.

734
00:27:19,725 --> 00:27:21,225
I think it's cool if I have a beer.

735
00:27:21,345 --> 00:27:22,414
MAN: Come on...

736
00:27:22,534 --> 00:27:23,959
let the girl have a drink, you know?

737
00:27:23,984 --> 00:27:25,398
Maybe Navid'll get lucky again.

738
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:27,019
Okay, what the hell is
this guy talking about?

739
00:27:27,025 --> 00:27:28,301
He's drunk, just ignore him.

740
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,721
Are you seriously telling me, man,

741
00:27:29,721 --> 00:27:31,116
that you didn't bag this chick... No.

742
00:27:31,129 --> 00:27:32,105
At that bar last weekend?

743
00:27:32,136 --> 00:27:35,039
Because the official Cronus
position, uh, is that you did.

744
00:27:35,045 --> 00:27:35,877
You know what, buddy?

745
00:27:35,914 --> 00:27:37,510
I think it's time for you to shut up.

746
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:39,956
Wait. Did you guys hook up?

747
00:27:40,019 --> 00:27:42,315
- Silver, it's not what you think.
- MICHAELA: Oh, my God, screw this.

748
00:27:42,352 --> 00:27:44,286
I don't care if Shane
and the rest of my family

749
00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:46,270
think I'm like the Whore of Babylon.

750
00:27:46,545 --> 00:27:48,197
Navid and I hooked up.

751
00:27:48,403 --> 00:27:49,673
All right? And who knows,

752
00:27:49,666 --> 00:27:51,162
- maybe we'll do it again.
- Hey, dude.

753
00:27:51,212 --> 00:27:52,406
What's your problem, man?

754
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:55,247
My problem is everyone
asking me what my problem is.

755
00:27:55,284 --> 00:27:57,255
(crowd gasps)

756
00:27:58,162 --> 00:28:00,214
Liam, what are you doing?

757
00:28:00,921 --> 00:28:02,790
I got to get some air.

758
00:28:04,343 --> 00:28:05,619
(grunts) Hey!

759
00:28:05,688 --> 00:28:06,864
Seriously?

760
00:28:06,984 --> 00:28:08,560
You have to give me a chance to fix this.

761
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:10,630
Being adopted doesn't make me an orphan.

762
00:28:10,668 --> 00:28:12,351
And it doesn't make you my Daddy Warbucks.

763
00:28:12,345 --> 00:28:14,385
I was fine before you came into my life.

764
00:28:14,397 --> 00:28:15,699
Yes, well, maybe I wasn't, okay?

765
00:28:15,755 --> 00:28:16,625
In case you haven't noticed,

766
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:18,182
my life is kind of a mess right now.

767
00:28:18,214 --> 00:28:20,478
I... I just... I really need my brother.

768
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:22,230
I'm not your brother.

769
00:28:22,445 --> 00:28:24,038
And I don't even know you.

770
00:28:28,042 --> 00:28:29,518
Fire!

771
00:28:32,255 --> 00:28:34,589
(tires squeal)

772
00:28:34,591 --> 00:28:36,708
(Naomi screams, Mark grunts)

773
00:28:36,828 --> 00:28:38,178
Liam, wait, where we going, man?

774
00:28:38,222 --> 00:28:39,780
(screams in distance)

775
00:28:39,786 --> 00:28:41,429
(screams)

776
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:55,922
Hey, that's the guy that punched me.

777
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,816
His name's Liam Court,

778
00:28:56,841 --> 00:28:57,999
and I want you to arrest his ass.

779
00:28:58,024 --> 00:29:00,176
Sir, you're gonna need to come with us.

780
00:29:00,182 --> 00:29:02,747
You got to be kidding me.

781
00:29:06,614 --> 00:29:07,816
Mark?

782
00:29:09,924 --> 00:29:11,400
I'm sorry.

783
00:29:13,922 --> 00:29:16,556
(Naomi sighs)

784
00:29:17,857 --> 00:29:19,978
Is she gonna be okay?

785
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:28,200
Hey, guys.

786
00:29:28,632 --> 00:29:31,347
I'm really sorry this didn't work out.

787
00:29:31,467 --> 00:29:33,005
We were killing it up there.

788
00:29:33,068 --> 00:29:34,119
But who knows?

789
00:29:34,112 --> 00:29:35,652
Maybe we'll still win.

790
00:29:35,721 --> 00:29:36,935
You know, honestly?

791
00:29:37,216 --> 00:29:38,305
We thought you'd put a little bit

792
00:29:38,305 --> 00:29:39,581
more into your performance.

793
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:42,466
You know, rip your top off like
you did at the charity event.

794
00:29:42,472 --> 00:29:44,656
But I thought you liked my singing. I do.

795
00:29:44,718 --> 00:29:46,388
But I said we were fans of your work,

796
00:29:46,407 --> 00:29:48,885
which includes showing
a little something extra.

797
00:29:48,941 --> 00:29:50,868
It's kind of what you're known for.

798
00:29:59,816 --> 00:30:01,435
You're here.

799
00:30:01,629 --> 00:30:03,237
I wasn't sure where you were going.

800
00:30:03,357 --> 00:30:05,515
Maybe you should put a
tracking device in my car.

801
00:30:05,558 --> 00:30:07,748
(laughs) I'm sorry,

802
00:30:07,786 --> 00:30:10,516
I just can't believe that you
slept with Navid and didn't tell me.

803
00:30:10,636 --> 00:30:12,518
Well, I can't believe you think it's okay

804
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:15,233
to dictate my behavior
for the next nine months.

805
00:30:15,508 --> 00:30:17,383
It's a baby, Silver.

806
00:30:17,385 --> 00:30:19,025
People have them all the time.

807
00:30:19,056 --> 00:30:21,102
Yeah, but this is my baby, okay?

808
00:30:21,222 --> 00:30:22,716
And since I can't carry it myself,

809
00:30:22,735 --> 00:30:25,788
I'm paying you to be responsible
and take it seriously.

810
00:30:26,664 --> 00:30:28,097
All right, look.

811
00:30:30,181 --> 00:30:31,713
I know this is weird for you,

812
00:30:31,732 --> 00:30:33,584
because it's really weird for me, too.

813
00:30:34,184 --> 00:30:37,112
I had a vision for how
my pregnancy would go,

814
00:30:37,344 --> 00:30:40,459
and it most definitely did
not involve a surrogate.

815
00:30:40,778 --> 00:30:44,621
So, everything that I was
planning on doing for my baby, I...

816
00:30:45,272 --> 00:30:47,243
I have to do through you.

817
00:30:48,381 --> 00:30:49,914
Does that make sense?

818
00:30:50,602 --> 00:30:51,616
Yeah, it does.

819
00:30:51,998 --> 00:30:53,675
But you spend so much time

820
00:30:53,681 --> 00:30:55,389
obsessing over this baby

821
00:30:55,402 --> 00:30:57,423
that you don't have time for anything else.

822
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,076
Not a relationship, not school,

823
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,358
not even your friends.

824
00:31:01,371 --> 00:31:05,214
- I just want everything to be perfect.
- And is it?

825
00:31:05,334 --> 00:31:06,733
Take it from me.

826
00:31:07,127 --> 00:31:08,935
From somebody whose family

827
00:31:08,979 --> 00:31:10,975
is completely over-involved
and controlling.

828
00:31:11,006 --> 00:31:12,921
It's not healthy.

829
00:31:13,041 --> 00:31:15,806
Not for you, and
certainly not for the baby.

830
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,532
Hey, Josh.

831
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:32,335
Hey, Campbell, uh,

832
00:31:32,572 --> 00:31:33,780
do... do you have a second?

833
00:31:33,805 --> 00:31:36,683
Man, I'm sorry Simon outed you
and that girl to all your friends.

834
00:31:36,702 --> 00:31:37,821
Kid's got a big mouth.

835
00:31:37,878 --> 00:31:39,630
But Liam really laid him out, huh?

836
00:31:39,698 --> 00:31:41,118
Hope he doesn't get into a ton of trouble.

837
00:31:41,112 --> 00:31:43,408
Yeah, well, I guess it
all depends on Simon.

838
00:31:43,452 --> 00:31:45,654
Yup. He's a... he's a Cronus guy, right?

839
00:31:45,723 --> 00:31:46,487
Mm-hmm.

840
00:31:46,493 --> 00:31:48,188
Is there any way that you could talk to him

841
00:31:48,219 --> 00:31:49,839
and convince him to let the whole thing go?

842
00:31:50,171 --> 00:31:51,829
Wait a second, you're seriously asking me

843
00:31:51,873 --> 00:31:53,306
to bend the rules for you again?

844
00:31:53,349 --> 00:31:56,008
Because I thought you had
a whole thing about that.

845
00:31:56,046 --> 00:31:57,153
Well, no, this is different.

846
00:31:57,203 --> 00:31:58,680
Okay, uh, Liam's a good friend of mine,

847
00:31:58,705 --> 00:32:00,456
and, uh, he could really use my help.

848
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:01,789
No, I get it, I really do.

849
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:03,991
It just... it seems a little unfair

850
00:32:03,991 --> 00:32:06,375
if you're not willing to
return the favor, you know?

851
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,828
The offer's still on the table.

852
00:32:08,948 --> 00:32:10,637
See you at the physics
final tomorrow, all right?

853
00:32:10,831 --> 00:32:12,576
- Yeah.
- All right, buddy.

854
00:32:23,263 --> 00:32:24,239
Hey.

855
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:27,761
I wanted to come and check on you.

856
00:32:28,305 --> 00:32:29,425
(sighs)

857
00:32:29,801 --> 00:32:31,365
Dixon found out about Mark,

858
00:32:31,653 --> 00:32:32,928
and he was okay with it.

859
00:32:33,498 --> 00:32:36,288
Turns out I don't need to worry
about him as much as I thought.

860
00:32:37,934 --> 00:32:39,617
Are you gonna be okay?

861
00:32:39,737 --> 00:32:42,401
I managed to screw up every
meaningful relationship

862
00:32:42,401 --> 00:32:44,203
I've ever had in my life, but...

863
00:32:44,747 --> 00:32:48,388
my, uh, husband, my sister,
my parents, everybody.

864
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,370
(chuckles)

865
00:32:49,939 --> 00:32:51,622
It's okay.

866
00:32:52,379 --> 00:32:56,933
I just wanted someone
to share a bond with me

867
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,941
that we couldn't walk away from, you know?

868
00:32:59,429 --> 00:33:01,275
Something like you have with Dixon.

869
00:33:01,288 --> 00:33:03,008
No matter what happens,

870
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:06,356
you always have each other.

871
00:33:07,413 --> 00:33:10,016
You're his something.

872
00:33:11,836 --> 00:33:13,907
And that's, uh...

873
00:33:15,263 --> 00:33:17,380
something I may never have.

874
00:33:17,442 --> 00:33:18,406
You don't know that.

875
00:33:18,526 --> 00:33:21,960
Since I don't have any more
half-siblings out there, I...

876
00:33:23,856 --> 00:33:25,139
Well, I figure,

877
00:33:25,376 --> 00:33:27,472
Mark was my last shot.

878
00:33:44,101 --> 00:33:46,930
That is one messed-up food truck.

879
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:51,239
Look, if Naomi sent you to
make some kind of sales pitch,

880
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:52,190
you can save your breath.

881
00:33:52,234 --> 00:33:55,400
I don't want anything to do
with her or your crazy family.

882
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,783
I totally get that.

883
00:33:56,796 --> 00:33:59,343
When I found out about
you, I felt the same way.

884
00:33:59,345 --> 00:34:01,037
I kind of got the feeling
you didn't like me.

885
00:34:01,157 --> 00:34:04,804
Yeah, well, family can
be a huge pain in the ass.

886
00:34:04,829 --> 00:34:06,324
I recently figured that out.

887
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:09,353
So I'm guessing you don't
have any brothers or sisters?

888
00:34:10,847 --> 00:34:13,374
My parents adopted me because
they couldn't have kids.

889
00:34:13,431 --> 00:34:15,902
- I gave them so much trouble, they didn't want more.
- Oh.

890
00:34:15,933 --> 00:34:18,348
My family adopted Dixon when we were eight.

891
00:34:18,468 --> 00:34:22,390
And even though it hasn't always been easy,

892
00:34:23,235 --> 00:34:24,968
it's really nice knowing
there's someone there

893
00:34:25,017 --> 00:34:26,481
who loves you and has your back.

894
00:34:26,539 --> 00:34:28,202
But maybe you have enough

895
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:30,391
people in your life like that already,

896
00:34:30,393 --> 00:34:33,338
in which case, congratulations.

897
00:34:33,788 --> 00:34:36,954
Anyway, Naomi wanted me to
swing by and give you this.

898
00:34:36,983 --> 00:34:39,269
She wants to take the truck off your hands

899
00:34:39,269 --> 00:34:41,590
so you can buy a new one.

900
00:34:42,911 --> 00:34:44,489
She didn't have to do that.

901
00:34:44,732 --> 00:34:46,252
You're right.

902
00:34:46,778 --> 00:34:48,104
She didn't.

903
00:34:54,666 --> 00:34:56,834
(sighs)

904
00:34:58,208 --> 00:35:00,070
- Hey.
- Mm.

905
00:35:00,072 --> 00:35:02,349
Hey, is, uh... is everything okay?

906
00:35:02,399 --> 00:35:04,195
Yeah, it will be.

907
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:07,855
That kid that I hit yesterday
decided not to press charges,

908
00:35:07,848 --> 00:35:09,430
so I'm off the hook.

909
00:35:09,432 --> 00:35:11,459
No way. Hey, that's... that's fantastic.

910
00:35:11,478 --> 00:35:13,498
Yeah. I could have really
hurt that guy, though...

911
00:35:13,618 --> 00:35:15,031
or Ade.

912
00:35:15,669 --> 00:35:17,522
I realized that I just
can't keep pretending

913
00:35:17,524 --> 00:35:19,023
like nothing's wrong.

914
00:35:19,025 --> 00:35:21,241
Yeah. So, uh, what are you gonna do?

915
00:35:21,926 --> 00:35:24,477
Well, according to my
court-appointed therapist,

916
00:35:24,498 --> 00:35:27,201
the first step is confronting
what happened to me,

917
00:35:27,226 --> 00:35:29,450
so... that's what I'm doing.

918
00:35:29,452 --> 00:35:32,286
You're not going to kill someone
with a screwdriver, are you?

919
00:35:32,757 --> 00:35:34,288
No.

920
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:36,290
(chuckles quietly)

921
00:35:36,292 --> 00:35:38,763
Oh, uh, by the way, I ran into Campbell.

922
00:35:38,778 --> 00:35:40,470
He wanted me to give you these.

923
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:42,947
Lakers tickets, court side.

924
00:35:42,949 --> 00:35:45,714
He said, uh, some of the guys
were going out to celebrate

925
00:35:45,752 --> 00:35:47,541
a physics test they aced?

926
00:35:47,661 --> 00:35:48,861
Oh.

927
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,990
Awesome.

928
00:35:57,013 --> 00:35:58,513
I got your text.

929
00:35:58,515 --> 00:36:01,298
What's wrong? Michaela
ran out of flaxseed oil?

930
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,056
(sighs)

931
00:36:02,088 --> 00:36:04,421
Okay, I totally deserve that.

932
00:36:05,772 --> 00:36:08,472
Look, I've been a terrible friend lately.

933
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:10,846
(sighs)

934
00:36:10,865 --> 00:36:12,172
I've been self-centered,

935
00:36:12,235 --> 00:36:16,045
and I've been totally
obsessed with this baby thing.

936
00:36:16,296 --> 00:36:18,460
I'm sorry. I miss you.

937
00:36:19,587 --> 00:36:21,301
I've really missed you, too.

938
00:36:21,339 --> 00:36:24,666
I'm not saying I won't still
occasionally check in on Michaela,

939
00:36:24,673 --> 00:36:26,090
or go a little baby-crazy,

940
00:36:26,881 --> 00:36:28,558
but I'm gonna try to
have a normal life again.

941
00:36:28,577 --> 00:36:30,761
You know, like, turn over a new leaf.

942
00:36:30,763 --> 00:36:32,645
I'm turning over a new leaf, too.

943
00:36:33,006 --> 00:36:36,116
That wardrobe malfunction
is going to follow me around

944
00:36:36,153 --> 00:36:37,935
as long as I'm in the spotlight.

945
00:36:37,937 --> 00:36:41,272
So I've decided to take some
time off from my singing career.

946
00:36:41,274 --> 00:36:42,961
That might be the best
news I've ever heard,

947
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:45,469
because I talked Naomi into letting me have

948
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:47,271
her brother's old food truck.

949
00:36:47,771 --> 00:36:50,129
What are you going to
do, sell burritos, or... ?

950
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,825
No, 'cause the kitchen's shot.

951
00:36:51,844 --> 00:36:54,078
But I figured...

952
00:36:54,497 --> 00:36:56,637
we can come up with something creative.

953
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:57,976
We could do something awesome.

954
00:36:58,045 --> 00:37:00,741
If you want to be my partner.

955
00:37:00,743 --> 00:37:02,562
Oh, my God!

956
00:37:02,682 --> 00:37:05,029
These are adorable! I love them!

957
00:37:05,031 --> 00:37:07,798
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes.
- Yes!

958
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,052
(laughs) Gonna be awesome!

959
00:37:10,053 --> 00:37:11,291
Yup.

960
00:37:11,328 --> 00:37:12,241
Yes!

961
00:37:12,248 --> 00:37:14,371
(laughter)

962
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:18,304
(doorbell rings) Ow. Oh.

963
00:37:18,424 --> 00:37:19,874
Come in!

964
00:37:20,293 --> 00:37:22,880
(footsteps approaching)

965
00:37:27,469 --> 00:37:29,320
Annie didn't give you my check?

966
00:37:29,322 --> 00:37:32,155
She did. I'm gonna make this short.

967
00:37:32,174 --> 00:37:35,276
I've always felt like I
had a pretty full life,

968
00:37:35,278 --> 00:37:37,393
and then you swooped in and...

969
00:37:37,612 --> 00:37:38,976
obviously need me.

970
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:41,131
(sighs) I'm not a charity case.

971
00:37:41,109 --> 00:37:42,281
I can order in.

972
00:37:42,335 --> 00:37:44,794
Oh, and waste such a beautiful kitchen?

973
00:37:45,755 --> 00:37:47,303
gives me an excuse

974
00:37:47,327 --> 00:37:50,675
Losing my truck to do something
I've wanted to do for a long time.

975
00:37:50,677 --> 00:37:52,351
And even without your jalapenos,

976
00:37:52,344 --> 00:37:55,110
I'm pretty sure I would have
kicked that fake Frenchie's butt.

977
00:37:56,862 --> 00:37:57,963
So...

978
00:37:59,008 --> 00:38:01,300
you still interested in
opening that restaurant?

979
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:02,862
Are you serious?

980
00:38:02,874 --> 00:38:04,845
A few rules. You leave the cooking to me,

981
00:38:04,914 --> 00:38:06,607
and no more surprises. Deal?

982
00:38:06,609 --> 00:38:08,731
Deal. I'm a horrible cook.

983
00:38:09,093 --> 00:38:10,783
I'll drop by tomorrow.

984
00:38:10,903 --> 00:38:13,460
You can show me this
amazing waterfront place.

985
00:38:16,935 --> 00:38:17,659
Oh.

986
00:38:17,696 --> 00:38:19,961
I'll see you later... sis.

987
00:38:20,605 --> 00:38:23,240
(footsteps retreating)

988
00:38:23,865 --> 00:38:26,542
(rock music plays on computer)

989
00:38:26,611 --> 00:38:30,247
(indistinct rock plays on
computer) * I once was lost *

990
00:38:30,249 --> 00:38:33,099
♪ But now I'm found ♪

991
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:37,979
♪ Was blind, but now I see. ♪

992
00:38:38,257 --> 00:38:39,505
Oh.

993
00:38:39,625 --> 00:38:41,076
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were here.

994
00:38:41,139 --> 00:38:43,986
No, no, no, don't...
don't... don't apologize.

995
00:38:44,013 --> 00:38:46,797
That was... that was actually pretty great.

996
00:38:46,799 --> 00:38:48,822
Too bad I didn't find anyone like you

997
00:38:48,841 --> 00:38:50,401
at that contest yesterday.

998
00:38:50,403 --> 00:38:51,062
What do you mean?

999
00:38:51,182 --> 00:38:52,651
I own a music label,

1000
00:38:52,771 --> 00:38:54,737
and I was there looking for new talent.

1001
00:38:54,857 --> 00:38:56,686
Um, someone I could turn into a star.

1002
00:38:56,806 --> 00:38:58,063
It was a complete wash, but

1003
00:38:58,119 --> 00:38:59,802
you know, it's okay. I'll be fine.

1004
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,134
I'm sorry, can we go back to the part

1005
00:39:01,115 --> 00:39:02,861
about you owning a music label?

1006
00:39:03,931 --> 00:39:06,214
Are you saying you could make me a star?

1007
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,862
I have to say,

1008
00:39:09,855 --> 00:39:12,865
I'm happy someone finally
decided to rent this space.

1009
00:39:12,985 --> 00:39:14,911
It's been empty for a long time.

1010
00:39:15,678 --> 00:39:17,939
So, what are you going to do with it?

1011
00:39:18,798 --> 00:39:19,934
I don't know.

1012
00:39:19,947 --> 00:39:22,212
Uh, I decided it was time

1013
00:39:22,224 --> 00:39:23,682
to start looking towards the future,

1014
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:26,641
and this seemed like
the right place to start.

1015
00:39:26,761 --> 00:39:28,637
Well, good luck.

1016
00:39:29,049 --> 00:39:30,945
Thank you.

1017
00:39:42,044 --> 00:39:44,753
<i>ASHLEY: You'll be traveling in this.</i>

1018
00:39:51,092 --> 00:39:54,044
<i>LIAM: You're gonna put me in a box?</i>

1019
00:39:54,251 --> 00:39:57,492
<i>ASHLEY: Just long enough to
ship you to Southern Mexico.</i>

1020

1021
00:40:07,784 --> 00:40:10,906

I'm doing this for you.</i>
